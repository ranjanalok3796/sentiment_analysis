"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nBest Blu-Ray Packing ( 3 Discs with Bonus Content, Includes Indian Languages)\nByAVon 21 September 2015\nFormat: Blu-ray\n|\nVerified Purchase\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 (3D)\nProbably the Best Spider-Man movie in Sound, Video and Blu-Ray Packing I have seen till now. The Movie is also good and fun to pass your time on weekends with family.\nThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 swings onto Blu-ray with a brilliant DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 lossless soundtrack. This is a classic new movie audio presentation. Everything performs seamlessly and in total harmony: music, effects, ambience, dialogue, the whole nine yards. Musical notes are smooth and nicely spaced across the front. Speakers seem to melt away in favor of the beautifully harmonious presentation that's aided by the perfect balance of surround support and low end pronouncement, whether light score, heroic trumpets, or heavy electronic-inspired beats.\nDialogue is nicely produced through the center, including Electro's deeper, scratchier voice. Overall, this is a showstopper of a soundtrack that's everything it should be, and then some.\nCredits:Bluraydotcom\nFirst 10 minutes of the movie is good Demo Material to showoff your HTS... Loved every moment in my 7.2 Channels.\nDisc Packing info:\nConsists 3 Discs ( 3D Blu-ray Movie, 2D Blu-ray & DVD with Bonus Contents)\nVideo\nCodec: MPEG-4 MVC\nResolution: 1080p\nAspect ratio: 2.40:1\nOriginal aspect ratio: 2.39:1\nAudio\nEnglish: DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 (48kHz, 24-bit)\nHindi : Dolby Digital 5.1\nTelugu : Dolby Digital 5.1\nTamil : Dolby Digital 5.1\nSubs: English, Hindi, Tamil, Telugu\nRegion Free\nRegards,\nAVBuffâ„¢ (Audio/Video Fan)\nComment\n|\n8 people found this helpful.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nBeautiful piece of Blu-Ray disc\nByAbhinooron 17 June 2016\nFormat: Blu-ray\nSo, my review once again starts with the quality of the product rather than the film... The Amazing spider man 2 Bluray disc looks stunning here with so much of the details..... The audio is available in multiple languages such as ENGLISH, HINDI, TAMIL, TELUGU and every part of the audio is in 5.1 surround sound to test the levels of your home theater and video quality is just amazing as its name goes by.... 10/10 for audio and video both......\nAnd this disc comes with so much of the bonus features included in the very same disc and this is only con part about this disc.... All the bonus features should have to be in a seperate disc just just to provide the main feature film more depth and details..... About ghe movie, movie is also very good but not the best but because of the superb quality of the disc, it is an nice addition to my collection.\nComment\n|\n3 people found this helpful.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n3D quality review and tips!!\nBySagar Rathodon 2 October 2014\nFormat: Blu-ray\n|\nVerified Purchase\n3D of this movie is just amazing, good depth, sharp details and immersive experience as expected from grand movie production like this. But most people judge 3D movies wrong because they are not watching the way it meant to be watched at home. After few months of 3D experience on my LG 47\" 3D TV, I came up with few points to enjoy 3D movies the way they are filmed. You need following things to have best 3D experience ever:\n1) Big screen 3D TV (passive 3D recommended) 47\"+ recommended. Bigger the screen, immersive will be experience. If you have 3D projector, you are lucky!!\n2) Dark dedicated room for TV OR watch 3D movie at night with all lights turned OFF in room.\n3) You need to sit at least 5-6 feet away from TV (my personal observation for 47\" TV), no more far from that. Smaller TV screen, closer you need to sit. And you may need to adjust your chair/recliner/sofa the way when you sit, you get maximum view of TV screen and not things around TV. It is mindset of people that you need to have large hall (living room) to have bigger screen TV or you notice pixels when seen from close. It is wrong perception of people mostly because people watch low quality content like SD channels or low quality downloaded videos on their Full HD (or 4K) big screen TVs. But if you watch any movie original Bluray OR video file which high bitrate close to original bluray, it doesn't matter from how far you look at your TV screen. You won't notice a single pixel. So it doesn't matter how close you sit to near to your TV, as long as you and your eyes are comfortable with it.\n4) Keep TV's brightness settings at optimum level and don't mess around 3D settings of TV. If you are not getting best 3D effect, you may have already messed up the settings which you may need to reset to original.\n5) If you wear prescription glasses, make sure you wear them underneath those 3D Goggles. Because if your vision is not clear without prescription glasses, you won't get good 3D effect too.\n6) If you are watching 3D movie with subtitles turned ON, then turn it OFF immediately. It hampers your 3D vision. If you are having hard time understanding movie without subtitles, then watch movie twice one with ON just to understand movie and one without to Enjoy the movie.\n7) And last but not least, invest in good home theater system. 3D experience is only 50% effective without good quality audio (at least 5.1 channel) supporting it.\n1 Comment\n|\n9 people found this helpful.

"review":"4.0 out of 5 stars\nThank you Marc Webb for making such an incredible Spider-Man sequel!\nByParthivon 21 January 2015\nFormat: DVD\n|\nVerified Purchase\nMy hopes and expectations were incredibly high for The Amazing Spider-Man 2. I was actually a little nervous going into this one. Lots of sequels have disappointed me over the years, but this was not one of them. Director Marc Webb's follow up was way better than the first Amazing Spider-Man film, and it might just be better than any of the Spider-Man films that Sam Raimi made. I'm going to have to rewatch them just to make sure, but as of right now I believe that it is.\nThe action in the movie was insane and extremely fun to watch. One of my favorite aspects of the action was how the hero of the story kept a sense of humor and cracked jokes throughout some of the fight sequences. Some of those scenes were very heavy, and it was just nice to have Spidey crack a joke every now and then to lighten the mood a bit. Of course, there are some events that take place that Spider-Man has to take seriously. If you were hoping to see some great action in the movie, then you'll be happy to know that it's there.\nComment\n|\nOne person found this helpful.
