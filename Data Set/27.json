"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\none of the coolest nfs\nBygaminglimeon 21 December 2016\nVerified Purchase\nLet me first justify why i brought a 2012 game in 2016;\n1. Most 2016 laptops with i5 or higher are capable of running this game\n2. fun open world game to play\n3. social aspect of the game is amazing\n4. origin offersmany dlc's for the game\nI had planned to buy nfs rivals but after trying it out it practically wasn't that good, you just did the same old school beat the opponent\nagain and again in nfs rivals , but nfs mw 2012 is different and i net you will enjoy playing it more than the former.\nComment\n|\n3 people found this helpful.
