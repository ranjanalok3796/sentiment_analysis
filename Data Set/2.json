"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nBest of its time and an 'EVERGREEN' game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\nByOhm R. Charanon 26 November 2014\nHardware Platform: Pc\n|\nVerified Purchase\nThe best game of its time and even if you play it now you are getting more than your money's worth!!!! If you are an ASSASSIN'S CREED series fan like me this is a must buy for you. You will get the same fun you that you will get in any assassin's creed game (overseeing AC Revelations and onwards) and if you only like very high graphics game think that it has graphics according to 2009 and see its price. It is an Excellent game overall and I repeat a must buy for AC series lover!\nComment\n|\n5 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nI love 😍 this game can't live without this!!!\nByRayyan51on 18 January 2017\nHardware Platform: Pc\nThis game is just plain fun to play. They made some significant improvements over the original AC game- the maps are much more detailed and easy to use, switching weapons is simple and intuitive, and the open- world aspect grants a lot of flexibility in how you want to play the game. For those who go for 100% synch, the ease of using the DNA menu, and you also have easy access to the Truth puzzles. The story itself is engaging, the main character, Ezio, is very likable, and there is a lot of variety in the gameplay. Puzzles, races, assassination contracts, and challenges... A lot to like in this game. Many of the details of the game are just done very well. A good example is the horses- the way they move and turn feels realistic- would the game be worse if the horses looked clunky? Probably not. But the attention to detail with something as mundane as the horses is indicative of just how well the graphics of the game look and feel. I believe I played through it 2 or 3 times and found new things each time! This one was much better than the original in terms of flow of the game and how easy it was to control the character.I have completed this game 5 to 6 times everytime it feels great for me and according to me this is world's best music game. I complete this game every year again and again and can't live without this:)\nComment\n|\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"4.0 out of 5 stars\nGreat game but needs online activation at least one time to play offline\nBysaravanapriyanon 13 January 2015\nHardware Platform: Pc\n|\nVerified Purchase\nI am addicted to this franchise.\nThis game is great, but has a short story.\nI love brotherhood than any other by the way.\nWhat disappointed me was that, this game needs an ubisoft launcher update to play offline(crazy one goes on loop saying downloading and then update failed and again downloading and so on..).However I figured out something to make it work offline.\nWorth the money.\nComment\n|\nOne person found this helpful.

Ubisoft DRM service doesn't allow you to play offline. The game never starts beyond the main menu. Not recommended for PC users.\nI tried resolving the issue with Ubisoft as well, but it was just a waste of time. And now I cannot even return this back to Amazon.\nPlease DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A PC. This game only works on consoles.\nComment\n|\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"
