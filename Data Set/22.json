"review":"1.0 out of 5 stars\nDont do it!! Turn around..RUN!!!\nByAnshulon 20 September 2015\nFormat: Video Game\n|\nVerified Purchase\nWorst mistake I have ever made. I've never played Battlefield and its likely I wont ever either. Not because the game is not as good as CoD or Medal of Honor but because the game refuses to load. The version of the game which comes in the CD is prehistoric (agreed it was released years back). You have to install the new version if you want to play the game..fair enough..click on Agree and then Install and its been 2 days...its still trying to update after about 15 errors.\nI have a pretty good gaming laptop so its not the configuration thats to blame, neither is my more than reliable internet connection. I have tried to update to the new version even at the office computer ( from where I am writing this review) with even better specs and net connection. But I think it just does not want to update.\nShould have stuck to the usual games. Guess somethings just aren't meant to be. *insert broken heart/cd package image here).\nComment\n|\n3 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"
