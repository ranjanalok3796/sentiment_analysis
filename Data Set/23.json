"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nI'm grateful that it's not a scam like the overwatch I bought over g2a\nByNaveenon 19 March 2017\nVerified Purchase\nExcept the price there is no negative remark, the copy is legit, key was brand new from origin, I'm grateful that it's not a scam like the overwatch I bought over g2a, which had fake key.. The game is solid .. I haven tried the multiplayer yet tho... Overall it's 10/10\nComment\n|\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"4.0 out of 5 stars\nBattlefield is one of the most amazing series ever produced by EA\nByRon Baruahon 22 February 2017\nBattlefield is one of the most amazing series ever produced by EA. This game focuses in World War 1, only a very few games are actually made based on World War 1. The visuals and graphics are way too realistic. There are a lot of things to do in-game, you can play as infantry, drive tanks, fly planes or even ride horses. The multiplayer experience is also good. The only negative part is a paper thin plot and too short single player campaign. The game eats up 50GB of memory in you hard disk and costs way too much.\nComment\n|\nOne person found this helpful.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nNo word. Just go for it\nByAmazon Customeron 12 February 2017\nVerified Purchase\nI dont have to write the review of this game. It will be unnecessary to write again. In brief the best multiplyer 1st person shooter i have ever played. The single player campaing is also worth playing. It comes with physical DVDs. If you dont have a wooden PC, just go for it\nComment\n|\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"
