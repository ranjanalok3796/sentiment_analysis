"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nG2A rocks.\nByAmiton 3 December 2016\nVerified Purchase\nThank you G2A for such a wonderful game at such an affordable price point. Witcher 2 is a block buster RPG game full of amazing gameplay and decent graphics, the story telling is amazing and leaves you wanting for more. Do play the Witcher Series. Its worth you time, if you like good stories and combat.\nComment\n|\nOne person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"4.0 out of 5 stars\nIt's only a printed serial number without game disc.\nByprranjal s.on 2 April 2016\nVerified Purchase\nIt's only a serial key. So you have to install Steam client on yr device and then from there you can register this serial and get a free download of the original game copy. The game is huge, around 8gigs or so. I haven't yet downloaded it becoz my broadband suffers from that stinky Fair Usage Policy, only 15gigs are faster then it goes down to 256KBPS which is considered Hi speed in India. I 'm trying to find out somebody who might have the dvd for this game so that i can just install it and register it with this serial key.\nComment\n|\n6 people found this helpful.
