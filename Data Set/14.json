"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nA masterpeice game\nByFarhan Shaikhon 3 April 2017\nHardware Platform: Playstation 3\n|\nVerified Purchase\nI got this thing today and I fell in love with this game. The story is great and graphics are really looking great on my PS3 (I avoid comparing graphics with other platforms). Soon after you install the game, you have to install 22 parts of update as of 3rd April 2017 which are approximately 1.2GB in total. You can skip the installation of these updates, but you cannot use online features. If you're a first time PS3 user, it will take some time for getting used to the controls. Overall, the game is a must have if you own a PS3.\nComment\n|\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nIts GTA!\nByramneet singh deolon 31 October 2016\nHardware Platform: Playstation 4\n|\nVerified Purchase\nWant to run down people in your SUV? Look no further. Want to rob a bank and come out like a boss? Look no further. The realistic gameplay elements like cars, crowd reactions and gunplay make this game a blast. Great Storyline with many whoa! moments and the variety of missions make this my favourite game hands down.\nComment\n|\nOne person found this helpful.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nGTA 5 is Life, Experince, Explore, Enjoy...\nByDigant J. Surtion 16 February 2017\nHardware Platform: Playstation 3\n|\nVerified Purchase\nGrand Theft Auto 5 is a masterpiece. It is a legendary game. Oh... Sorry, I don't want to call this a 'game', its a Miracle, GTA5 is an open world, action-adventure, third person video game developed by Masters of Game Developers, \"ROCKSTAR\". They are brilliant in their game design and gameplay design and experts of environment design. There is so much of realism in their every work. Their every game is a masterpiece. Here GTA5 will satisfy you with everything you want to do in your life. Imagine there are no rules in your life, what will you do, this the fun of GTA5, go get the chance to experience, explore, enjoy an unforgettable beauty of this game. Graphics are gorgeous, gameplay is stunning, story is superb, what else you need, \"How many hours it takes to complete this game?\" many people ask. Here you can complete some quest and play GTA Online, This is a never ending game in my opinion. Hope this review helps you. Buy it and let me know your experience. IGN gives this game 10/10 and states that its a \"Masterpiece\". Many people get confused what to buy first, The Last of Us, God of War 3, or some other game. Those two are also considered as great games because of their mind-blowing story-telling and gameplay design. But I tell you, This game is not a game, its a life, if you will buy this game first, its an open-world. you will never get bored, you will replay it again and again. This is Grand Theft Auto 5. Enjoy.\nComment\n|\n20 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

Right now i completed 10% game still many things need to discover.\nBest thing about ps4 is you can play as first person move .\nCompare to pc , it only have 1 disc while pc having 7 discs and 5 GB update.\nThe only con i found is you need to download 8gb update to play online, extra features, social club.

"review":"4.0 out of 5 stars\nA bit tiresome😥😥\nByMyworld2912on 31 January 2017\nHardware Platform: Pc\n|\nVerified Purchase\nGot it yesterday, well if you're thinking of buy it , don't wait just grab it but be aware before buying it make sure you have a good internet connection (preferably 2mbps).After installation you're required to download an 8gb update and then another 540mb patch.However it wasn't the case for me after downloading the update game started in online mode but because of some work I had to close the game and when I came back to continue where I left off ,it started downloading another update of rockstar social club(70mb) and after signing in it started another update of 4gb ,so I cancelled it and tried to start in offline mode but it got crashed every damn time so finally I put it on download, and is still downloading.although I can look it up on Google to bypass this process (if there are any)but right now I don't feel like doing it after all this and yes I forgot to mention one more thing, it took 3hrs to install this game. And you all know about the game.happy gaming\nComment\n|\nOne person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"
