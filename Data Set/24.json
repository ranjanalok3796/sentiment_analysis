"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nGot this one in a lightening deal @ ₹25 only... :)\nBySteve Rogers..TOP 500 REVIEWERon 18 January 2017\nVerified Purchase\nYou wont believe me if I told you that I had got this game on 1st october 2016 in lightening deal at only ₹ 25... Seriously nobody would dare to believe that.\nIts MRP Is 999, and I got it at only ₹ 25...\nThe gaming graphics is very good. This is a 100% original disc. The prouct key is mentioned inside the box and you have to activate the game by using online stream account..\nAfter installing the game you will get a pop up message that you need to download additional 5.3 gb to update the game. But dont need to worry about it will actually download near about 300 to 550 mb..\nAfter installing the game you can play the online mode and also you will able to play the game in offline mode also...\nGaming graphics is good and gameplay is also good.\nThank you..\n1 Comment\n|\n6 people found this helpful.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nIf you like crashing cars\nByToaston 12 March 2017\nVerified Purchase\nThis game is no longer available for purchase on Steam but the retail key included with the DVD still activates the game on Steam. It was previously available for free from HumbleBundle sometime in Jan 2017 and it had its last sale on 25th Feb 2017 at 90% off for Rs. 47. It was then removed due to some licensing issue.\nI got it here after its removal for Rs. 99, double the discounted price but you only have to download ~200MB after installing from the DVD. I also don't see any region restriction on playing the game from outside India during travel.\nComment\n|\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"2.0 out of 5 stars\nYou need to have internet connection to install and use this game!\nByAmbarish BVon 18 October 2016\nVerified Purchase\nIt asks for internet connection for setup. We need to download about 300 to 400 MB of additional updates from the internet and create account. I didn't like the way this is setup. It should be a clean setup and should not ask for any internet connection.\nComment\n|\nOne person found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"2.0 out of 5 stars\nThanks for your price its an honor from me , thanks amazon for providing me this game at this much of price\nByAmazon Customeron 11 October 2016\nMost horrible game i have ever seen it requires 4G internet to download extra updated 10GB game data , and its original product from STREAM NETWORKS which requires 15 gb hard disk space 3 GB Ram is minimum, so if you dont have internet at you home dont buy this product , it may cost you more ....for installing this you need to make an account of stream and need to cheak your google account for a message ...its really trobling game , i never saw install procesure like this game in my life .... .but the games graphics is too good and game play is like motorstorm pacific rift...its multiplayer game upto 4 players. I.e offline , online is upto 12 players ...its you decision to accept this product to you home door , i actally got this product at Rs.25 only and its real price is around Rs.1000 ...so not a waste for me ......thank you amazon\nComment\n|\nOne person found this helpful.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nAwesome price!\nByAADITYAon 20 October 2016\nThose idiots who rate games 1* or 2* saying it's steam version,keep your mouth shut ,who wants to pile up all discs and loose the games when we get a scratch on DVD? Who wants to insert the disc every now and then to play a game? And who wants to stack 100s of DVDs on ur self and kill time searching for a game cd u want to play for that movement? Or who wanna play the whole game again if you don't have a cloud save feature like the one that steam offers?\nABOUT GAME-its cool game and is for those destruction fans!though it's from dirt series,it has nothing to do with other dirt games.super quality graphics on ultra setting and stunning camera angles make it evenmore enjoyable!\nComment\n|\nOne person found this helpful.
