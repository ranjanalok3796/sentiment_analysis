"review":"1.0 out of 5 stars\nPirated Game + Misleading Product Image\nByHarsh Rathodon 6 May 2016\nVerified Purchase\nI was expecting original one but it was pirated. The game is not the one as sold by UBIsoft. The seller is producing illegal copies of this game without any license from UBIsoft. Also this game has been downloaded from internet by the seller. When I had recieved it; it wasn't even packed in it's own unique box as sold by UBIsoft with Map or Manuals. But was delivered to me in some cheap DVD cover on which the seller printed this games's cover as you can see in the images above. Moreover, the game and the fack printed game-manual in it were in Russian language making the installation and playing further complicated. The seller even removed the UBIsoft logo and put his own on the DVD cover. I'm very disappointed and I didn't expect it from amazon.\n2 Comments\n|\n17 people found this helpful.
