You must have the xbox hard drive to be able to run this game.\nBest COD Game till date. The graphics on the xbox 360 still feel like modern warfare 2. The multiplayer is the main key...

"review":"4.0 out of 5 stars\nA lot of Fun!\nBySharanon 31 March 2015\nHardware Platform: Playstation 4\nWhat you are seeing is Advanced Warfare\", Something that Kevin Spacey had said during the beginning of the campaign that made the whole game sound badass, but the whole focus here is on the multiplayer that would have players play for countless hours. The Supply drops are interesting to receive, since you wouldn't know what 3 items could be inside, an easy way to exploit your way into getting one is to quickly get yourself killed at the start of any game mode match which is odd, since it works every time.\nThe graphics are good, it was just not my main focus when I was playing this game or it just didn't stand out to me to start taking a screenshot every sec. The sound, some guns sounded great while some just sounded a bit weak.\nWhat is making this game for me fun? The Exo movement, it was a much notable function that was more then what I was expecting. You could dash on the ground or while in the air in any direction or slam down on an enemy. While in the match it just feels funs jumping and dashing everywhere to kill other people doing the same thing, it's pretty arcadey, which I like.\nThere are no kill streaks, It's now called score streaks. It's when you gather enough points for your uav or something. There are not that many since you can now instead upgrade your score streak in multiple ways, like for the Uav you can have it last longer and/or send it orbital where it can't be shot down and/or have it detect where enemies are pointing and much more. It would cost the streak more, but it would make it a lot better, so it actually happens to have more score-streaks then you may have thought. A feature that I happen to appreciate highly, since it rewards for those who support or just follow the objectives.\nPick 13, not sure if that was a good decision, but it does work well. You can remove your score streaks for more points or add another one, which is nice.\nGood Job Sledge Hammer, you managed to create a CoD that's fun to play\nComment\n|\n8 people found this helpful.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nBest of Call of Duty series yet !\nByVivek Deepon 17 May 2015\nHardware Platform: Xbox One\nI have done a complete review on the game and the top 10 games currently out there with links to discounted price, Do check it out.\n[...]\nThings I Loved:- The campaign is solid with many worthwhile moments, good level design and enough juxtaposition. Great character performances by the actors. Missions in the campaign that border on excellence. The Exo suits bring some much needed variation to the gunplay and introduce verticality and fast movement to the traditional gameplay of the franchise. Excellent visual presentation. Multiplayer is buttery smooth and is improved with the inclusion of the Exo suits. Mutiplayer cosmetic items you achieve through normal play are a nice little addition. Exo Survival is good fun with friends.\nVerdict:-\nAdvanced Warfare is an overall solid offering with a satisfying singleplayer campaign and fun multiplayer. There are some faults with the campaign such as the annoying button prompts and the restricting linear nature, but it still offers some good moments. The Exo suits offer some new avenues to explore within the gameplay and offer some variation in the multiplayer arena. The game is still good value for money and one that Call of Duty fans will no doubt enjoy.\nFor more details:-\n[...]\nComment\n|\n19 people found this helpful.

"review":"4.0 out of 5 stars\nWorth buying it for the campaign.\nByRishion 7 August 2015\nHardware Platform: Pc\n|\nVerified Purchase\nFinally Activision did a good job on the new CoD. Firstly the campaign was adrenaline pumping for the first time you play it. I would suggest you play in veteran in your first try. The campaign as usual is 6-7 hour long which only took me two night to finish. I was actually disappointed buy Activision on Ghosts.\nMultiplayer is DEAD!!!\nIt says no games found on actual matchmaking and you can only play combat readiness program.\nNo dedicated servers for this so that actually destroys multiplayer.\nDo not buy it for multiplayer and simply free download it from Utorrent for campaign.\nAlso asusual you need steam for it and it does a 6.6 Gb update without which you cant play\nI'm only waiting for BO-3\n:3\nComment\n|\n4 people found this helpful.
