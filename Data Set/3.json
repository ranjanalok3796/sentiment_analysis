"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nBest AC So far.\nByAkhil Polaon 27 January 2016\nHardware Platform: Playstation 4\nThis has to be the best AC game for the next generation console so far ( Syndicate is pretty good as well)\nWe all knew Unity was a disaster at launch.\nHaving played Unity as well, I can say if you had to choose between Unity and Black Flag , ALWAYS go for Black Flag.\nThe open world map is pretty huge. It takes a lot of time to travel all around the West Indies.\nI always loved the pirate themes i.e. POTC movies , One Piece anime. This game lets you like the life of a pirate.\nThis game has content for more than 100 hours easily.\nThe side missions are an absolute blast. The main story is pretty good as well.\nBut nothing comes to close to those naval battles. Fighting ships with your Jackdaw is pretty amazing.\nThe fighting is better than Unity hands down.\nThe graphics are pretty amazing.\nThe game is pretty cheap IMO. You can find better deals if you buy the digital version. The PlayStation Store usually has some deals.\nKudos to Ubisoft for creating such a brilliant game which is still popular more than 2 years after its release.\nComment\n|\n5 people found this helpful.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nThe game's veryyyyyyyyyy good!\nByOhm R. Charanon 12 April 2014\nHardware Platform: Pc\nThe game's very good and if you don't believe me see the other reviews and you will know and don't believe the 1 star reviews as they are just frustrated the game didn't work on their pc as the game requires high graphics, fast processor and high ram to work in full resolution. The game has many weapons like the previous Ac3 game and interesting and adventurous main missions and side missions like naval contracts, assassin contracts, underwater exploring,etc. which are amazing. And if that's not enough you can explore the whole Caribbean sea with the Jackdaw and fight and hunt down ships, board them for fun and use the resources obtained for upgrading the Jackdaw or including it to our own fleet of ships and there are many islands for us to explore. The game's story is strong and very finely detailed and will keep you hooked to it until it gets completed. The present day story is not so much interesting and the only reason Ubisoft kept it was to continue the present day story of the previous games. The only thing you will find a little interesting is hacking computers of the other abstergo employees. And back in the main game the most important Thing is that is it has been rated as the best pirate game ever made so its recommended for you to buy it and a must for every assassin's creed series lover.\nComment\n|\nOne person found this helpful.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nPirates of the Caribbean\nByCJ BrosTOP 100 REVIEWERon 20 October 2016\nHardware Platform: Playstation 4\nIt is 1715. Pirates rule the Caribbean and have established a lawless pirate republic. You are a young captain named Edward Kenway. His exploits earn the respect of pirate legends like Blackbeard, but draw him into an ancient war that may destroy everything the pirates have built.\nThis pirate themed Assassin's Creed is too good. There is massive caribbean to sail. There are gorgeous and unique islands to explore. There are tombs to raid and much more to do. Black Flag is all about embracing freedom and carving your own path through the world. Naval battles are awesome. You will love sailing the ships for sure. The main story is very catchy. Side missions are also good. This game was launched in 2013 but the graphics are really next gen. I also have Assassin's Creed: Syndicate (PS4). But i will definitely say that Black Flag is better than Syndicate. There is Version 1.04 (2.314 GB) patch that fixes some bugs. According to HLTB, the main story is around 22.5 hours.\nThanks for reading. Happy gaming.\nAdd me on PSN: \"jenishtrambadiya\"\nComment\n|\nOne person found this helpful.

"review":"4.0 out of 5 stars\nEpic Game !\nByVaibhavon 11 December 2014\nHardware Platform: Pc\nAssassin Game + Pirate Theme + Naval Combat + Stunning Visuals = Black Flag !\nThis game is simply epic. The visuals are stunning and very much improved over it's predecessor (AC III).\nNaval Combat - The best part of this game is naval combat .You can upgrade your own ship & can ride with it wherever you want , you can attack other ships for loot and can take their crew.\nStory - Story is above average , Not the best but certainly not the worst.You will have no problem with it.\nGameplay - The Gameplay is awesome , Naval combat is Excellent , Open world which is designed beautifully by Ubisoft. There are plenty of things to do other than story missions. Combat is great & Variety Of Missions.\nI loved the Soundtrack also .\nThe presentations is awesome & you will love pretty much everything about this game , fully enjoyable.\nComment\n|\n5 people found this helpful.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\ngreat game 9.5\\10\nByaayush kumar chaurasiaon 24 March 2016\nHardware Platform: Playstation 3\n|\nVerified Purchase\nThis game is a must-have for the ps3 I loved every moment of mowing down British and Spanish soldiers and plundering ships, though you will start feeling disappointed for the first 4-6 missions, but will soon love it after completing the main 6 missions consisting of you disguising yourself as Duncan Walpole to freeing yourself with adewale. The story is great too and of course the huge variety of missions and activities I'd give this game a 9.5\\10 pros :- everything pirate and assassin\nCons :- frame rate drops in Havana for the ps3 super slim and the stupid be online to access the fleet and getting additional 60 min gameplay\nComment\n|\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"
