"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nIt's the code not the game! You need to download it your self!!\nByAbhinav utkarshon 4 September 2016\nVerified Purchase\nFirstly I would like to make it clear That in box you get a code and a CD, which when inserted gets connected to steam and then for DOWNLOADING CS:GO it asks the key!

A minimum of 10.4 gb data is downloaded during the process. If you have a very good internet connection then it will be fine otherwise it will take a whole day.\nTalking about the game it is best as CS always has been. And one more thing you can also play it offline with bots.\nI am playing it on my Windows 8.1 and its running smoothly.\nComment\n|\n6 people found this helpful.

It will be hard to get used to after playing 1.6 but it is worth it.\nNOTE : This CD doesn't contain installation, it just allows you to register the game online on your steam account i.e you have to DOWNLOAD the game online and keep it updated.\n2 Comments\n|\n34 people found this helpful.

I got the Steam Key Code and then installed it. Listen this game is insane. Get ready to spend thousands of hours on this game because the urge to rankup will never leave u alone.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nReview for delivery, how Steam works and the game...\nByMithil Bhorason 1 November 2015\nGot this game for just 240 rupees in the lightning deal. Yeah, better than what Steam is offering! And that too before expected time, great job Amazon.\nAs I got the game just today, I'll focus only on the Steam aspect:\n-You have to have a steam account, it's free.\n-But to activate it, you have to put some money in the steam wallet (don't worry, the money will remain in your account, won't go anywhere and you don't have to pay anything extra after buying the game). I guess you can put any amount you want but am not sure. I put a dollar and it worked fine for me.\n-Since this retail version is 2014 package, you have to download a very huge update of exactly 5.5 gb. No more, no less. You cannot play this game without this update.\nThese do seem to be the downside but it's at least better than buying the game on steam for the following reasons:\n-Currently it costs $14 there. Too expensive.\n-Even if you buy from Steam, you'll have to download the entire game which is well over 10 gb (even over 15 gb I guess). So it's better to buy the cheap retail cd as it already has half of the game. That ways, it won't eat away your entire internet data pack.\nI've uploaded a pic of how your steam account will look after installing the game. The great news is you can install it any number of times on any other laptop or pc system. This cd will also run on a mac! Just be sure that you install steam first and login into your account before installing it on another system.\nSo, hope this solves all the questions you had reading all the reviews given here. You have to sacrifice something but it's better to buy this game here to save as much internet as possible.\nYou can play single player but it gets really repetitive. So please try multiplayer.\nWill update on the game soon as I'm done playing it for hours! :)\nUpdate: The game is mind-blowing. Played for hours and couldn't stop, my God! It's extremely improved version of the original CS, with rich dialog work, nice environmental touches (eg: chickens run around in some of the maps), multiple approaches to our objective... In addition, there's a tool that allows you to make your own maps, or so I've heard. You can make your own maps using the Steam Workshop eventually when you get bored of the game. In addition, you can download other players map for free from Steam! There more than a hundred thousand of these things. There's absolutely no limit to this game!\n3 Comments\n|\n48 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nBuy it From here Not from steam\nByJayaprasadon 25 March 2017\nVerified Purchase\nThe product was delivered to me 4 days earlier for which I am really thankful,It contains CD and A Card with instructions and steam code. The CD has 700MB data in it, However you will have to download the rest of the data which is approximately 6GB.This comes 100RS chepaer than in steam and you also save 700MB data,So i believe this waa better value for money.

Go to steampowered.com and download steam\n2. Let it update and then make your account or login\n3. Insert the disc and double click on it\n4. Install Cs go\nThis procedure will result in 4.8 GB to be copied from the disk and only 2 GB of updates downloaded from the internet.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nAwesome Game!!!!!\nByWinter_Soldieron 25 July 2016\nVerified Purchase\nReceived it much before the given date, product was nicely packaged into cardboard box. Kudos to Amazon for fast delivery and packaging.\nComing to the game we get a CD which is of no use and a steam code which can activated online on steam client.\nTried couple of times to run CD but it wasn't installing game.. Finally had to download whole game of 6.4GB from steam. It took nearly 2hrs on my Internet connection to download game.\n#PROS:\n1.Game has now lot details and high end graphics which is definitely gonna be liked by all.\n2.Plenty of steam add on's\n#CONS:\n1.If you're used to play Counter strike source alot... Then u'll find bit difficult to handle guns in this edition. U've to be more precise and accurate with your targets.\n2.Needs very good Internet connection.\nConclusion :\nThis is an awesome game and all gaming freaks shouldn't miss this.. I'm totally in love with it.. And spending my holidays on it day and night :)\nDon't wait, just buy it.\nComment\n|\n2 people found this helpful.

"review":"3.0 out of 5 stars\nGo for the Game code, not the CD\nBySamarTOP 500 REVIEWERon 17 January 2017\nVerified Purchase\nCounter Strike Global Offensive is one of the most popular global multiplayer game. After CS 1.6 and CS source, Valve has released CSGO, and this game is awesome. The graphics has improved, you get better weapons, it has become more realistic. There are abundance of online players and valve servers are very good too. With a speed of over 1MBps, you can easily play CSGO online with friends accross the world. The network connection must be static and at least 3G speed. When the game runs, you should turn off all the downloading stuffs in the background or else your ping will falter and be very high.\nIt's a cool FPS game with vast multiplayer experience. Two thumbs up for buying the game.\nBut this come in CD format, i won't recommend to buy CD, purchase it directly from Steam, or purchase the CSGO code from Amazon. It's easy to redeem the code and get the game in your STEAM library. After adding the game to your library you just need to download and install the game files on the computer, it will start automatically. After that ready your gears and roll out in the world of chickens and dufuse kits... hehe ENJOY\nComment\n|\n5 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"
