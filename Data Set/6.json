"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nYOU NEED TO PLAY THIS!!!\nByArnavon 7 March 2016\nVerified Purchase\nIf you have played first person shooter games before..... I recommend you to not play this game in the easiest settings because then u will find this game too easy.... And you will find it being completed really early than you would have expected.... Overall its a great game and a great time killer too\nComment\n|\n4 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nBest Call of Duty !\nBySuhailon 13 February 2016\nVerified Purchase\nBest of Duty in my opinion. I Am now going to check out MW2.\nTo get it short and straight , if your PC meets the minimum specs get this game straight away without any question doesn't matter if u love CoD or not. It's worth every penny and is a must play game for any gamer.\nThe single player campaign is just awesome. U wouldn't ask for anything better.\nI guarantee u that The multiplayer will be loads of fun. Doesn't matter whether u like playing online or not , whether u have played online or not , u have to check it out. I am someone who didn't play any online multiplayer game before and I didn't look for multiplayer in games as I thought it wasn't my cup of tea and didn't interest me. After playing for quite some time I decided to try out multiplayer for the first time in my life, and I got hooked to it the very first minute even though I got smoked out by others on the first day. Since then I left the single player campaign midway and I play only multiplayer on this now, it's so much fun. After some time , I play decent at online and the keeps getting bigger and bigger as u improve. It's hard to keep it down.\nComment\n|\n3 people found this helpful.

"review":"4.0 out of 5 stars\n4 stars because of multi-player !!\nBySuman Bakshion 27 January 2016\nVerified Purchase\namazon service is good !! no doubt on that :D (5 stars)\nnow about game :- single player is very good (5 stars) ,\nbut multi-player is total waste (2 stars). i bought this game to play multi-player but after install(easy) when i connect to multi-player servers it cant connect to any servers, problem is that the key code is already used as it is very old game . as many players used pirated keygen so now this key code become nothing .and activision site has nothing to support about cod mw . so i successfully waste my 460 rupees. and as the key code is already used so amazon not replacing this item. so i request to all buyers think before buy this. and my another advice is this game does not need steam.(as steam is best for multi-player games because of Valve ). this game require punk-buster (you need to update from site after install). good luck have fun :) :)\nComment\n|\n5 people found this helpful.
