"review":"4.0 out of 5 stars\nDon Bradman Cricket 14 Review\nByViswanath Aluruon 4 May 2015\nVerified Purchase\nGreat Game by Big Ant Studios.\nOne of the best cricket games.\nPros :\nExcellent graphics (Don't compare with FIFA or PES)\nIntuitive controls with PC controller allowing to play shots all around the park\nNot a every ball can be hit for a six which promises many hours of fun and a good competitive AI\nDecision Review System (DRS)\n20 year Career Mode\nDon Bradman Cricket Academy which allows editing and creating teams, players and even umpires\nGood tutorial and training mode\nVarious animations for running, catches and celebrations\nCons :\nRepetitive Commentary(worse than ashes cricket 2009)\nComputer fielders sometimes seem to take superhuman catches and have very accurate throws\nRequires Internet connection to play\nOverall Verdict :\nMust buy game for all cricket lovers. Great game to start with if this is your first cricket game.\nTip :\nDonot try to play the game on PC without a PC gamepad which comes included only in the limited edition(The one which is described in this review)\nPackaging :\nExcellent packaging by Amazon\nDelivered within two days on standard delivery\nConclusion :\nLooking forward to more great cricket games from Big Ant Studios\n1 Comment\n|\n9 people found this helpful.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nThe best cricket game ever\nBySociopathon 28 April 2016\nI bought it from steam for Rs 500/- so my review is totally based on game.\nSimply the best cricket game ever. Gameplay is far better than EA sports Cricket 2007 and Ashes.\n1. Career mode: You start from domestic cricket and try to get into national team with your performances. Batting is difficult, you cant go all guns blazing. you have to practice in the nets to improve the skills where spin bowling is much easier.\n2. You can play it online with your friends.\n3. You can Edit players or simply download it from other users.\n4. You can download patch to replace unlicensed players.(in order to get their original names)\n5. Controller is must to play the game.\n6. Commentary is repetitive.\n7. can create your own team.\n8. Fielding could have been more realistic but still better than other games.\nComment\n|\n7 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nExcellent game for cricket lovers\nByJanishon 5 January 2017\nVerified Purchase\nExcellent game. Best game ever played. Previously played EA Sports, But this one is good. Great graphics, above average commentary (missing Richie benaud's voice though), career mode is good and long. I have seen youtube videos of DBC17, feels DBC14 has realistic players. DBC17 players looks like zombies.\nComment\n|\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nThe best cricket game ever\nByArindam Sharma Royon 18 February 2016\nThanks to the online playability, humongous community-created content and timely patches by the developers, among other things, the game is near flawless. I didn't regret buying this game for one second. If you are a fan of cricket and a fan of video games, order this game right away!\nP.S. If your controller doesn't seem to be working, you will have to press the Mode button, which will then glow red and activate the sticks.\nComment\n|\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"4.0 out of 5 stars\nGood game with great visuals but might not appeal to all PC/console cricket lovers\nBySiddharthon 13 July 2016\nVerified Purchase\nThe game has a great visual appeal and has quite an impressive gameplay.\nHowever, it is not the kind of Cricket for PC that people have played before.\nWill take quite a while to get hold of it.\nMoreover, the energy and excitement of cricket is somewhat missing in the game.\nI am freak for Cricket on PC/Console, but not really playing this one a lot.\nA few people may or may not like it.\nBTW, the limited edition bundles with a controller (Chinese brand but decent in quality) and a SteelBook (nothing but an additional Metal Jewel Case to preserve/showoff your Game DVD)\nComment\n|\n2 people found this helpful.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nBest cricket game ever\nByDhananjay ghogaleon 16 May 2016\nVerified Purchase\nBest cricket game ever. The graphics are very nice and gameplay is excellent. At Rs.1400 its completely worth it since it comes with a controller too. I cant personally comment on the quality of the controller since i use the xbox controller, but it looks ok. If you are looking for a good cricket game then just go for it. Also to be noted is the point that this is not a licensed product, but you can download the squads with proper player and team names.\nComment\n|\n3 people found this helpful.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nMost advanced cricket game I have ever played so far.\nByrajkumar pandeyon 29 December 2015\nMost advanced cricket game I have ever played so far, if you are gonna buy it, go for it. You will not regret. Such great graphics and the career mode will keep you eager to play more and more. Its so addicted and so realistic that will make you go crazy if you are a cricket lover. A perfect game, very well designed.\nYou can only play with the game controller, the one which is given in the box is not that sensitive so if you can buy a better one will make the game controls better.\nIt works absolutely great on Win 8.1.\nComment\n|\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"
