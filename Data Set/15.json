"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nBroadband connection needed.\nByAmazon Customeron 25 March 2017\nHardware Platform: Pc\n|\nVerified Purchase\nNice game with good graphics .But the only thing is if you don't have a broadband connection you could not play this game.\n1. At first u need some 400mb for steam update\n2.Then u use the first cd in the box for installing\n3.The second cd is not needed ,it downloads about 12 gb from steam on internet.\nSo guys be cautious. And if u have a broadband connection buy this game\nI haven't played yet.Best u buy ACT Fiber net broadband\nI have finished the game. This games is so hard and it is a best stealth game.\nPlay its sequel Hitman\nComment\n|\n2 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nA MUST OWN!!!!\nBySamuel Osbornon 28 July 2014\nHardware Platform: Playstation 3\n|\nVerified Purchase\nThe plot of the game which requires prowess and strategy to see the game through will satiete the Hitman disciples. The thrilling chase will keep the gamer hooked till the very climax of the game. The plot thickens as 47 who is assigned to eliminate Diana and bring back Victoria, will play by his instinct and go against the agency.\nThe game is a steal for the price. A must have for every Hitman fan..... Stay in the shadows and savour every kill!!!!\nThank you Amazon for prompt delivery.\nComment\n|\n2 people found this helpful.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nGreat Game\nBykartik kochharon 24 April 2014\nHardware Platform: Xbox 360\n|\nVerified Purchase\nWas somewhat in a dilemma while placing the order as the platform stated Nintendo Wii instead of Xbox 360. Took the gamble as I was aware of the Amazon's Amazing return policy. The product was delivered on the mentioned date. packing was fine and well protected. Would recommend anyone to opt for this game as its a steal at this price.\nHave checked other websites however they stated that the disc was ripped from Steam and 2 GB of game needs to be downloaded. However the game was a complete retail copy and an update of only 2MB was required from Xbox Live.\nWould recommend other to buy this game.\nThanks.\nComment\n|\nOne person found this helpful.

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nSuperb !!\nBylokeshon 11 June 2014\nHardware Platform: Xbox 360\nHaving played all the previous Hitman games,i had to go for this as well. but i didn't purchase it immediately, i waited for a discount sale and got it for 400 bucks only,ya that's right, an xbox 360 game for just 400. anyways coming to the gameplay, it left me in awe,the story was interesting enough for me to finish it within 8 days of 2 hour sessions. also replayability is an issue,once you know the plot it doesn't interest you to play it in another level. but nonetheless, its an amazing game and a must buy for all hitman fans.\nComment\n|\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"4.0 out of 5 stars\nGreat game, not much to complain about.\nBySiddharth Senon 5 March 2015\nHardware Platform: Playstation 3\n|\nVerified Purchase\nA very good game. Installs fast. Gameplay is amazing, will keep you on your toes. I would reccommend playing it on hard at least, that's where the concept of stealth and creativity really come into play. Graphics are nice but could be sliiiightly better. I enjoyed this game a LOT. Would reccommend it to anyone who likes stealth games with violence in them. Could be a bit more open ended, but still fun.\nThanks to amazon for quick delivery.\nComment\n|\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"
