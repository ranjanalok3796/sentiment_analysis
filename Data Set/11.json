"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\n_Definition Of Insanity_\nByManish Kotawadekaron 31 May 2015\nHardware Platform: Pc\n|\nVerified Purchase\n\"Did I ever tell you, the definition of... insanity?\"\nFrom the moment you start playing this game you realize that the world is not a sweet good place that you hav always believed it to be. And this feeling goes on getting stronger as the game progresses till the end.\nEven the most good & gentle people have to wear the cloak of insanity when it is required for survival & revenge.\nJason (main protagonist) & his friends, along with his siblings, are on a trip to Rook islands. They are misguided by a spotter onto an island filled with pirates & smugglers, who kidnap wealthy people, extorts money from them & then sell them to slavery or sex trafficking.\nOnce caught by the pirates & wathibg his family killed by the pirate overlord Vaas before his very eyes, changes start occuring in Jason. Given a chance to escape he slowly learns to use the island & it's powers to his advantage.\nHunting, killing & collecting bounties help him get stronger, maniac for power. In the end he finds out that he himself has become the very person he had set out to slay! But he has a choice.\nBe sure to experience this crazy adventure pf psychological changes!\nTechnical aspects:\n1. There are lies by people who have given 1, 2 stars. They either never played good fps games before or never know how to install them. NO 5-6GB download is required.\n2. You need good internet connection to install the game. Ubisoft account is must required if you are playing for first time. For that the game installs a \"ubisoft launcher\".\n3. After the game is installed a 250mb upgrade patch has to downloaded from official website. (The link opens after installation.) You can download it before too & install it later in the main folder. Without it you will get glitches. Other patches are optional.\n4. After installing the patch you can definitely play it offline by selecting \"offline\" mode in the ubisoft launcher menu.\n5. If you are uninstalling the game, make sure to copy the patch installations in different folder, in case you want to play the game in future. 'Cuz uninstalling the game deletes the patch installation file too.\nComment\n|\n13 people found this helpful. Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"4.0 out of 5 stars\nFAR BETTER than 1 and 2\nByManion 7 October 2014\nHardware Platform: Pc\n|\nVerified Purchase\nFar cry 3 is far better than 1 and 2. Lot of improvements in terms of graphics and game playing objective.\nIf you love violence then this is a game that gives you lot more to enjoy.\nWork very well with 512MB graphics card and 2GB of RAM.\nInstallation is pretty straight but after installing the game - it is controlled by Uplay which would ask you to update recent patches released (may be 5 patches ). No issues found on game performance.\nWhen you play in offline mode, it would check for connecting to server each time when you press ESC button (bit annoying but ok).\nLot more side objectives are there apart from main missions so this game might take longer days to complete.\nComment\n|\n2 people found this helpful.

"review":"4.0 out of 5 stars\nAwesome game but prolonged installation\nByPradeepon 20 December 2014\nHardware Platform: Pc\n|\nVerified Purchase\nI got this game during the Google Online Shopping Festival 2014 for Rs.300 and it is a steal at that price. The game has beautiful graphics, huge open world, freedom, challenging enemies, an assortment of weapons and a good story.\nThe most irritating part is installing the game. The box comes with 2 DVDs. It takes more than 30 mins to install from both DVDs. After this the DVD will install Uplay(needed to play Far Cry 3) after which it'll start updating Uplay after which you need to create a Uplay account(yay another account! Steam and Origin accounts weren't enough I suppose) and register the CD key to the account. Then when you finally try to launch the game it'll start updating the game(another 280MB) and then it finally lets you launch the game.\nThe game takes about 2 mins to load even the main menu. If you don't have the latest drivers or if you are playing on a decent laptop, get ready for crappy performance. After updating to latest drivers, performance increased a lot. However I still get less than 30fps at lowest graphics possible even though I'm using my laptop at high performance and its overheating to 90C(I recently cleaned the laptop and used Arctic Silver thermal paste). I have AMD APU and GPU but still the game performs horribly.\nYOU ALSO HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET(BECAUSE EVERY ******* GAME NOWADAYS NEED 24x7 INTERNET CONNECTION FOR SOME ******* REASON). You can still play even if you are not connected but the ******* game keeps trying to connect to servers whenever you press Esc for main menu. WTF happened to the days when you could play games hassle free without needing a hundred accounts and being connected to the internet 24x7???\nIf you have a good desktop or laptop and don't mind long installations then you're sure to enjoy this game throughout. I am really annoyed with the installation procedures.\nUpdate:\nI finally finished the game and am not too impressed with the second half of the story. Still worth playing though. The most irritating part is the loading time. Even with an Intel quad core desktop processor and Nvidia GTX 750Ti, it takes more than a minute to launch the game and load the main menu. It takes some time even to load a saved game. If you are not connected to the internet the stupid game will still try to connect to servers every time you press Esc for menu.\nComment\n|\n9 people found this helpful.

"review":"4.0 out of 5 stars\nFar Cry 3 - Fun to play!\nByRahul KULKARNIon 10 August 2015\nHardware Platform: Pc\n|\nVerified Purchase\nPros: Beautiful world to explore, Great variety of weapons\nEven Greater variety of playstyles (stealth, action, hybrid) Strong cast of characters with is good story arc.\nCons:\nSide quests are a bit light on content.\nMultiplayer is a bit weak\nOverall:\nOne of the best games of 2012. A huge return to the greatness of FC1 mixed with the best parts of FC2. An open world game with a great cast and great story, mixed with flexible gameplay that really gives something to any player. The action is explosive, the direction of the story sequences is intense at times, but still I can't really feel at home on these islands. Far Cry 3 is the ultimate open sandbox: The player can do what he wants, where he wants it, when he wants it. But the credibility of the world suffers ‚Äì and with it my motivation.\nIt is an exceptional FPS with fun mechanics and excellent characterization. Unfortunately it wastes a fair number of opportunities offered by its huge open-world background. Plus, the secondary activities are not as fun as they could have been, and the island is too extensive to be interesting in the long run.\nComment\n|\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nFar Cry is a great game that is very similar to the Grand Theft Auto games\nByChristopher J. Cowenon 9 October 2014\nHardware Platform: Playstation 3\nFar Cry 3 is a great game that will having you wanting for more once you finish the game. This game is very similar to the Grand Theft Auto games. The game is an open world game that is set in the jungle. The game has tons of different missions and none of the missions feel repetitive in nature. The game mechanics are good and there are some good Role Playing Game (RPG) elements to the game which makes you want to upgrade your character. You can easily get about 50 hours of gameplay out of this game. The game does not have any dead spots and is definitely not boring.\nI enjoyed this game and would definitely recommend this compilation.\nThank you for reading my review, if you have any questions feel free to email me, I would be happy to help you with any questions you have.\nComment\n|\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"

"review":"5.0 out of 5 stars\nGreat game\nByGurjap Singhon 24 May 2014\nHardware Platform: Playstation 3\n|\nVerified Purchase\nAs far as games for PS3 go, it's competitively priced. The SP campaign has a good, decent length, and features a notorious Final Boss: Vaas. Vaas proves himself to be crazy as hell early in the game, and hovers like a shadow throughout the campaign. Mos Def's character (can't think of him as anything else) is great, and I won't spoil a surprise regarding his role.\nFeatures a good array of weapons, great topography and well designed AI for enemies. Unlike FC2, enemies don't seem to respawn. One advise: Try it at hard settings or else it might be too easy.\nGraphics are pretty good, and remind you of Creed: Black Flag or Tomb Raider.\nComment\n|\nWas this review helpful to you?\nYes\nNo\nReport abuse"
