Got it yesterday, well if you're thinking of buy it , don't wait just grab it but be aware before buying it make sure you have a good internet connection (preferably 2mbps).After installation you're required to download an 8gb update and then another 540mb patch.However it wasn't the case for me after downloading the update game started in online mode but because of some work I had to close the game and when I came back to continue where I left off ,it started downloading another update of rockstar social club(70mb) and after signing in it started another update of 4gb ,so I cancelled it and tried to start in offline mode but it got crashed every damn time so finally I put it on download, and is still downloading.although I can look it up on Google to bypass this process (if there are any)but right now I don't feel like doing it after all this and yes I forgot to mention one more thing, it took 3hrs to install this game. And you all know about the game.happy gaming
