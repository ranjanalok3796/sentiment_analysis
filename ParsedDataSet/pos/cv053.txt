This game is just plain fun to play. They made some significant improvements over the original AC game- the maps are much more detailed and easy to use, switching weapons is simple and intuitive, and the open- world aspect grants a lot of flexibility in how you want to play the game. For those who go for 100% synch, the ease of using the DNA menu, and you also have easy access to the Truth puzzles. The story itself is engaging, the main character, Ezio, is very likable, and there is a lot of variety in the gameplay. Puzzles, races, assassination contracts, and challenges... A lot to like in this game. Many of the details of the game are just done very well. A good example is the horses- the way they move and turn feels realistic- would the game be worse if the horses looked clunky? Probably not. But the attention to detail with something as mundane as the horses is indicative of just how well the graphics of the game look and feel. I believe I played through it 2 or 3 times and found new things each time! This one was much better than the original in terms of flow of the game and how easy it was to control the character.I have completed this game 5 to 6 times everytime it feels great for me and according to me this is world's best music game. I complete this game every year again and again and can't live without this:)
