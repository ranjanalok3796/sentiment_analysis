No doubt the game is captivating.I enjoyed playing it. Really good campaigns.different environments in different campaigns.Disguise as dog and attack enemies fight with shark 60 feet under water.Graphics are awesome too.not played multiplayer yet.the only thing that dissapoints is the length of the campaigns are very less it just gets finished very soon.
