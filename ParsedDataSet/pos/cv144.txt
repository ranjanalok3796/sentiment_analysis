Good game......Ofcourse not better storyline than arkham asylum and arkham city. Boss battles like bane(all three),deathstroke and firefly on the other hand r very nice. Graphics is also much better than than the prequels (rilis wise). In other words a good game. U do have to download like 16 gb of data from steam. But still worth the money,time and data.
