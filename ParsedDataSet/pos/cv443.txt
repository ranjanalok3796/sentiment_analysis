I was stuck in deciding which game should I buy far cry 3 or dmc 5 (both for pc).I ended up buying far cry 3 after reafing al the positive comments and let my tel u it does not disappoint. I don't didn't expect much from the game as I was not a first person shooter fan but after playing this game I have become a fan.This game delivers in all the 3 aspects 1.the story 2.the game play 3 . graphics. .I strongly recommend this 2 any gamer who looking to have fun
