Square enix was very particular to state that this game has 400 plus square miles of virtual playing area in all the pre-reviews that they had done. And prior to the 12th December update from steam, that was basically bundled with a game which has numerous frame drops in extreme settings and high load times. The blast sequences and physics are pretty nice, with the added bonus of the parachute climber.Cons :1. Random frame drops and high load times2. Linear story line with mediocre cut scenes to bundle with3. Repetitive after some timePros:1. Very expansive gameplay level2. Weaponised vehicle DLC (for pre-orderd retail)3.Blast and movement physicsIn all, its passive fun, but it has a long way to go before it catches up with the likes of Farcry and GTA in the level of replay dynamics. But if its a consolation, it does have some of the best blasts in-game
