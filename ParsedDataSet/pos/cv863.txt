I am not quite thrilled while playing this, as i was when i saw the trailer. Quite confusing in the beggining, or maybe a little too complicated, dunno how to put it. But all my gaming life, this is one game that ive not felt like coming home to play. Maybe as the game progresses, it might get interesting.
