The first time I had played the Mortal Kombat game was on my old school gaming platform SEGA. That time I was hooked onto the game, the first time I laid my eyes on it. The graphics and the controls, and all the fatalities were amazing. Fast forward to 20 years later, and we have the Mortal Kombat X for the Xbox One. I am an avid Call of Duty gamer, and also play sport games as well like FIFA, NBA, Racing and more. The graphics on the Mortal Kombat X are really good and very detailed, and at times to the extent of being graphic. The bones cracking, spine crunching, eye ball gouging, head splitting, ball crunching moves are all good. However, after the first 4-5 times of playing it, I got bored. There is a storyline added to the game to make it interesting, but it still becomes monotonous. After 20 years, I would have expected something more than just an addition in storyline. When Call of Duty can bring something new year after year, I would have expected that Mortal Kombat would have been loaded with awesome stuff. But it does not. Otherwise, it was an ok game to play. Brings back memories to fight with the old players like Liu Kang, Rayden, Johny Cage and more. Compared to the Sega systems, the fatality combinations are much easier. It is costly for the level of eagerness if would generate once you have the game. I would prefer to play a game of COD multiplayer or FIFA multiplayer than put in the CD for Mortal Kombat.
