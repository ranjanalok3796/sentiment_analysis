Watch Dogs, the game with a huge amount of hype lived upto its expectations (kind of). The game is awesome, the graphics are awesome, the gameplay is good (except for driving),etc. This game is awesome and the reasons that i have given it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it is practically broken. The game does not operate well in pc. You can search the pc problems on google. There are alot.So you are better off buying the game on a ps4 or xbox one.
