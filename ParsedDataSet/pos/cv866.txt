Maybe Watchdogs was hyped a lot by Ubisoft, so it was not as good as people thought it would be.But the game as a whole is really nice.The hacking feature is awesome and the gameplay is spectacular.It is a really good game for a hardcore gamer.And as far as amazon is concerned, as usual on time delivery!!!!!
