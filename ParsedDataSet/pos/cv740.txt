Incredible in most ways. There are a million MGSV reviews out there so I'll keep this short. The action here is not frantically paced like a regular FPS, instead it makes you think - there are a million different ways to accomplish the objective and the AI intelligence is top notch. There are so many bells and whistles, all kinds of weapons, gadgets, easter eggs. I've coded a chess game all by myself and it still blows my mind how mere mortals can accomplish these incredibly intricate AAA games. Hats off. Oh and if you're a hardcore Kojima fan like I've become, follow him on Twitter... :)
