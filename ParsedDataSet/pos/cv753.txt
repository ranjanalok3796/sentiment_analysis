Ensure you have unlimited internet plan and lots of patience before you buy this.The five star is for the game and the genius that is Hideo Kojima.The game disc is essentially pointless as it contains only an 8.78 MB Steam Installer so Konami gets a -2 star from me. Its a 999 worth CD KeyLets face it downloading 20.4 gigs is a "Pain" in itself.But is the game worth the time, money and download ?Absolutely, a brilliantly crafted stealth action experience unlike any other. It will grip you right from the start, Kojima is a genius, the game feels like a movie. And the best part ? Its very very well optimized for PC's and runs very very smooth. This is my third Metal Gear game, don't worry about the story even regulars have trouble grasping it.A great way to end a 28 year old series.
