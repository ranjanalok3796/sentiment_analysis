Well batman is batman u doubtedly great game ,its more elobarate bigger world and great graphics with super villains all that u need in batman game ,i can definitely so though arkham city was impressive game but this one is better ,personally i think arkham asylum is best amomg all games of batman till now because of its unique psycho horror theme but for batman fans or ps3 owners its a must buythe exceptionaly amazing thing in this game is music bgm is really movie like i say better than that even if u hve home theater or even simple tv .stages are well defined nothing seems repetitive which u may find frequently uin even amy good games,dont mess with difficulty level u may find AI more teasing than expectedflawless moves are easy to achive (if u know and hvae played earlier games) easier than arkham city and when batman is in flawless mode he rocks with heavy combos .a great game for all gamers ,specially ps3 ones PC etc platform wont have great grahic or motion rate and tahnu need dowloads too best is get pss and get this game , an important game in any gamers collection ,has tremendous re play value
