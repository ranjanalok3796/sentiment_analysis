This is without doubt one of the best games ever for PS4. You can literally hack anything and it's an open world game. Excellent graphics, story line and game play. It may take bit of time to understand the controls but when you are used to the controls then it would be fun :) Appreciate the on time delivery of Amazon. Cheers!
