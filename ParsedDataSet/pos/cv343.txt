The product was delivered to me 4 days earlier for which I am really thankful,It contains CD and A Card with instructions and steam code. The CD has 700MB data in it, However you will have to download the rest of the data which is approximately 6GB.This comes 100RS chepaer than in steam and you also save 700MB data,So i believe this waa better value for money. Make sure to download steam to your pc before purchase to make installing Ease. Hope i helped :)The product was delivered to me 4 days earlier for which I am really thankful,It contains CD and A Card with instructions and steam code.
