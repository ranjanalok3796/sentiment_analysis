I had order this game and it was delivered in time. During installation everything went fine but it struck at the date check. It was always failing for the date check online and at last I have changed system date then it got installed. For the rock star game social club also it is not signing in. It always says to check internet connection although I have net connection. So I am playing the game offline. Other than that the game works fine.
