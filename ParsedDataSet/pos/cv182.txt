Format: Blu-raySo, my review once again starts with the quality of the product rather than the film... The Amazing spider man 2 Bluray disc looks stunning here with so much of the details..... The audio is available in multiple languages such as ENGLISH, HINDI, TAMIL, TELUGU and every part of the audio is in 5.1 surround sound to test the levels of your home theater and video quality is just amazing as its name goes by.... 10/10 for audio and video both......And this disc comes with so much of the bonus features included in the very same disc and this is only con part about this disc.... All the bonus features should have to be in a seperate disc just just to provide the main feature film more depth and details..... About ghe movie, movie is also very good but not the best but because of the superb quality of the disc, it is an nice addition to my collection.
