I had no option left but to purchase a PC version of the game since PS4 was so expensive and I already owned a PS3. Thanks to Sony they ruined my happiness with Steam (absolute nonsense platform) which forces its users to download obscene amount of data given our Internet provider speeds. It's as good as downloading 3-4 games at once which will slow you down until you lose all interest in the game. I have hardly played this game to my satisfaction and its asks for an update which takes eons to complete. I have uninstalled the game and god forsaken Steam from my computer for good. Never again will I go for Steam. Had to let out some steam myself!!!
