I had pre purchased this game, got some extra mission. FarCry is one of my fav. Franchisee. Graphics and Story line is great. Taming of animals is the best part in the game. The game would have been much interesting,but ok. However, i was bored playing with guns, but this game was a great change for me. Completed the game in 3 days, playing it again.The package of the game case is not at all good. I had brought far cry 4(rest of the series had got it from steam) ,its packaging and user manual was great comparatively.Overall, a must play, but the price is too high for it!
