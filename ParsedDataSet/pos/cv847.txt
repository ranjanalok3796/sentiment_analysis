Well I like ubisoft for their different genre's of games.It is a truly different game.I dont understand why people compare it to GTA . Both are in different league's. Well this game is beautiful visually and you dont have to use guns but use the technology to kill.Its fun andb ou can intrude into peoples lives and know their secrets.Only let down is its weak story but there are numerous side missions and it is enjoyable.Enjoy the game guys.Its totally worth its price.
