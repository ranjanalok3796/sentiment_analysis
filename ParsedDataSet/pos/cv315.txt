This is the typical Call of duty that is released every year. (even months).and Activision knows that kids will buy them anyhow.anyway the all round story is 7 out of 10.and leaves a taste of what ghosts 2 is going to be about.The same old graphics and zebra u.i.The online is also...um...mehMy favorite is Kill Confirmed and InfectedThe selling price is also very inexpensive on amazon I got it for â‚¹849I would rate it 7.8 out of 10must play for the love of COD ðŸ˜œ
