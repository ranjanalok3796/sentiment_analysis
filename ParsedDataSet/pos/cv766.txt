The game is a masterpiece with top graphics and storyline. Combat, online gameplay faction amd Arena Interaction are all great. But the problem is, to enjoy it you have to download nearly 30+ GB of game data from the internet. Its really annoying to have purchased a physical copy of the game and still download such huge amount of data unlike the GTA 5. The only difference between the Steam copy and physical copy is that you actually pay less to the latter. Go ahead and buy the game if you are a fan of fighting games and ONLY if you have a large bandwidth with decent speed. Any players feel free to add me on Steam - karthictu
