The PC version runs great if you have a capable rig and looks fantastic. Story is a bit weak but the gameplay in general is extremely fun. The online component of this game is unique and will you give you quite a bit of re-playability. But there are small bugs which I'm sure will be patched. Overall a great game but nothing very memorable.
