Was somewhat in a dilemma while placing the order as the platform stated Nintendo Wii instead of Xbox 360. Took the gamble as I was aware of the Amazon's Amazing return policy. The product was delivered on the mentioned date. packing was fine and well protected. Would recommend anyone to opt for this game as its a steal at this price.Have checked other websites however they stated that the disc was ripped from Steam and 2 GB of game needs to be downloaded. However the game was a complete retail copy and an update of only 2MB was required from Xbox Live.Would recommend other to buy this game.Thanks.
