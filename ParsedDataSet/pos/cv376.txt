I bought it from steam for Rs 500/- so my review is totally based on game.Simply the best cricket game ever. Gameplay is far better than EA sports Cricket 2007 and Ashes.1. Career mode: You start from domestic cricket and try to get into national team with your performances. Batting is difficult, you cant go all guns blazing. you have to practice in the nets to improve the skills where spin bowling is much easier.2. You can play it online with your friends.3. You can Edit players or simply download it from other users.4. You can download patch to replace unlicensed players.(in order to get their original names)5. Controller is must to play the game.
