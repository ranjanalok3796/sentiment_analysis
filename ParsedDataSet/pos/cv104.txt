This game is a must-have for the ps3 I loved every moment of mowing down British and Spanish soldiers and plundering ships, though you will start feeling disappointed for the first 4-6 missions, but will soon love it after completing the main 6 missions consisting of you disguising yourself as Duncan Walpole to freeing yourself with adewale. The story is great too and of course the huge variety of missions and activities I'd give this game a 9.5\10 pros :- everything pirate and assassinCons :- frame rate drops in Havana for the ps3 super slim and the stupid be online to access the fleet and getting additional 60 min gameplay
