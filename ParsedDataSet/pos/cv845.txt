I was not sure whether I would like to play this game but one fine day I decided to take a risk and buy it, and it was definitely worth it. The eye-catching graphics and the extremely creative and innovative concept of being a hacker and being able to exploit almost anything in the entire Watchdog universe was amazingly interesting and something gamers have never experienced beforeIt keeps you wanting to explore the vast world inside the game because you never feel bored by the game. If you like an Open-world, Free roam as well as mainstream missions then this is the game you are looking for.I still play it and has definitely been worth each and every penny, go for it!Watch Dogs (Xbox One)
