Awesome game.The good part is you can play offline.It gets better if you have good headphones on while playing,cuz you really feel like you are in the Stone age.Another good part is that the story is not linked to any of the previous games in the far cry series.The only bad part is that you can complete the story if you sit for 24 hours.overall a very good experience
