Battlefield is one of the most amazing series ever produced by EA. This game focuses in World War 1, only a very few games are actually made based on World War 1. The visuals and graphics are way too realistic. There are a lot of things to do in-game, you can play as infantry, drive tanks, fly planes or even ride horses. The multiplayer experience is also good. The only negative part is a paper thin plot and too short single player campaign. The game eats up 50GB of memory in you hard disk and costs way too much.
