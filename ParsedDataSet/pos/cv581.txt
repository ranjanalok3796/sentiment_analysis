Nice game with good graphics .But the only thing is if you don't have a broadband connection you could not play this game.1. At first u need some 400mb for steam update2.Then u use the first cd in the box for installing3.The second cd is not needed ,it downloads about 12 gb from steam on internet.So guys be cautious. And if u have a broadband connection buy this gameI haven't played yet.Best u buy ACT Fiber net broadbandI have finished the game. This games is so hard and it is a best stealth game.Play its sequel Hitman
