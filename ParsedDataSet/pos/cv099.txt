It is 1715. Pirates rule the Caribbean and have established a lawless pirate republic. You are a young captain named Edward Kenway. His exploits earn the respect of pirate legends like Blackbeard, but draw him into an ancient war that may destroy everything the pirates have built.This pirate themed Assassin's Creed is too good. There is massive caribbean to sail. There are gorgeous and unique islands to explore. There are tombs to raid and much more to do. Black Flag is all about embracing freedom and carving your own path through the world. Naval battles are awesome. You will love sailing the ships for sure. The main story is very catchy. Side missions are also good. This game was launched in 2013 but the graphics are really next gen. I also have Assassin's Creed: Syndicate (PS4). But i will definitely say that Black Flag is better than Syndicate. There is Version 1.04 (2.314 GB) patch that fixes some bugs. According to HLTB, the main story is around 22.5 hours.Thanks for reading. Happy gaming.Add me on PSN: "jenishtrambadiya"
