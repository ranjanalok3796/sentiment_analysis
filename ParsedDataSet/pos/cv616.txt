Having played all the previous Hitman games,i had to go for this as well. but i didn't purchase it immediately, i waited for a discount sale and got it for 400 bucks only,ya that's right, an xbox 360 game for just 400. anyways coming to the gameplay, it left me in awe,the story was interesting enough for me to finish it within 8 days of 2 hour sessions. also replayability is an issue,once you know the plot it doesn't interest you to play it in another level. but nonetheless, its an amazing game and a must buy for all hitman fans.
