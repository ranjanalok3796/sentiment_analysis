I've never played any of the previous Metal Gear games from the series. I picked this up not expecting much out of the gameplay, but I was wrong. It turned out to be one of the best action/stealth games of this generation. The gameplay unarguably the best thing about this game. The story was weird, to put it mildly, it never explained the inner workings and happenigns of the game world through cutscenes or dialogue, instead choosing to let you decide if you want to know more or less by putting the story in "cassette tapes" for you to collect and listen to. Even then the story doesn't have an actual conclusion. It just abruptly ends. However that did nothing to stop me from enjoying the 300 or so hours I put into this game and how much I loved all the characters (Quiet and DD for life!).NOTE: A little reading up on previous games will be required to fully understand this one and where it fits chronologically in the Metal Gear series. A solid game otherwise, no pun intended.
