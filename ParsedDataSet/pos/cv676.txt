Bought it for my XBOX 360 Xbox 360 4GB Console (also bought from Amazon)...This game gives the same experience and pleasure as earlier 2 Max Payne titles, only with better graphics, greater gameplay.And yes if you are worried about the bald look, among the 2 DVD story, Max does have hair all the time in DVD 1 just like old time... only at the end of DVD 1 story, he shaves it :)Does not matter if you are a Max Payne fan or not, just buy it now when it is only Rs 350, if you don't want to regret later :)
