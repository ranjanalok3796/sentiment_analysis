I am addicted to this franchise.This game is great, but has a short story.I love brotherhood than any other by the way.What disappointed me was that, this game needs an ubisoft launcher update to play offline(crazy one goes on loop saying downloading and then update failed and again downloading and so on..).However I figured out something to make it work offline.Worth the money.
