This game has some really kick-ass graphics, although not next gen like Infamous:Second Son, but they're really GREAT!!The game might seem to be a drag at some point of time(just like this review),but it gets better if you continue. My Rig couldn't run it at the highest specs available(graphics card isn't that great after all), but even high specs seem really good.Amazon's delivery system is really great..if you want, order it here.(cheapest!)
