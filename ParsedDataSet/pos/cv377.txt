Good Game. A must buy..Good Game. A must buy..Very well packaged.... with controller...XBOX and Play station are better in terms of Graphics and controls..PC version advantage is you can download add-ins and use themIt take lot of time to get use to controls but once you know it than its very interesting to play..Try playing net session first..
