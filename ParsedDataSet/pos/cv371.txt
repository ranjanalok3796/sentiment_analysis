Worked perfectly. Great game. Only drawback is this purchase won't make you eligible for adding friends on steam. For that you have to make purchase on steam itself. I'd advise you to do it now, since purchases on steam are now in Rupees (earlier it was in USD, costing more, so the retail purchase made sense).Worked perfectly. Great game.
