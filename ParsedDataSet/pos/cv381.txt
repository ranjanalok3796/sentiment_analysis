Thanks to the online playability, humongous community-created content and timely patches by the developers, among other things, the game is near flawless. I didn't regret buying this game for one second. If you are a fan of cricket and a fan of video games, order this game right away!P.S. If your controller doesn't seem to be working, you will have to press the Mode button, which will then glow red and activate the sticks.
