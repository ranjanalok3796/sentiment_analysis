Platform for Display: PC|Edition: Standard|Verified Purchasefirst i wanted to tell people who thinking about system requirement, i'm running this game smoothly in 1080p in high settings.My spec are I3 processor, 8GB ram and GTX960 Card and other peoples are telling if you have GTX 650 or higher can run it.About DeliveryI pre-ordered the game but they delivered it after two days of lunch so i'm not satisfied wit hit because what is the use of pre-order if not getting on lunch day. Amazon may conceder this and start deliver on same as lunch day.About gamei played for 40hr and i'm in level 20 in main game and level 18 in dark zone(my uplay id is Diablo_Ace). one of the best game by Ubisoft and Tom Clancy and its a masterpiece. i not yet completed the main story so i don't want to tell anything about it but as for i played its very good and keeps interesting.Dark zone is multi player, where you can't trust anyone they may kill you and take your loots so best to play with team.P.S need permanent internet connection required.
