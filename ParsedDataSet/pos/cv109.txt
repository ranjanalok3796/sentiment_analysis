Ya its a good game having a strong storyline and graphics are well improved comparing previous series. If u like pirates kind of genera u will love this game. Apart from main storyline side missions are also fascinating. U can dive underwater to find treasure and lot more.I gave 4 stars because game looks somewhat slow. U can't play it through out the day. U will get bored.
