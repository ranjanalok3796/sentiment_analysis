I bought this game like 10 months ago so I know the best about it and I bought it from right here. I got the Steam Key Code and then installed it. Listen this game is insane. Get ready to spend thousands of hours on this game because the urge to rankup will never leave u alone. New players don't go compi and casual asap first practice a lot with bots and aim maps then think of going online. PS: Skins are so sexy I spent almost Rs.2000 on them. Try to stay away from them ðŸ˜¶I bought this game like 10 months ago so I know the best about it and I bought it from right here. I got the Steam Key Code and then installed it.
