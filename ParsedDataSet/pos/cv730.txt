This game doesnt need any reviews. Most - or I should say - all professional reviewers have given this 'ten on ten', and thats for a reason. This is, by far, the best Action Game, ever.It is a tactical espionage stealth game, but you can play this open world game, as openly and as u want, as possible. Approach "a" base in russian-military-occupied afghanistan at any time in24 hours, from any direction, at any pace, all guns blazing, or, calmly with tranq guns, doesnt matter, all that matters is the end result of that particular mission. How you do it, is up to the "player". The game does have a huge learning curve for those coming to the series for the first time, but those who have played any MGS before, especially Ground Zeroes will feel right at home.This is the best MGS ever.Enjoy playing it
