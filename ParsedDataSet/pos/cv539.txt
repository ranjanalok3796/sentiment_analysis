The package was absolutely amazing and I got it after one day of order,however it was out of stock when I actually planned to buy this. It had 7 disks,map,booklet and a code for running the game.Had to wait 2 days for it come in stock but it was worth it. The installation took 2.5 hours and a total of 14.8 gb of 4-5 patchesMy specs::::::I3 3220@3.3 GHz6gb ramZotac GeForce Gtx 1050 ti 4gb(single fan)RedGear keyboard and mouse.I get smooth 60-70 fps in normal graphic settings but laga sometimes while fast driving(no fault in game but in my pc)
