The best game you can get on your Xbox 360!! The game has the best graphics in any Xbox game! The story line is pretty good! The Exo Zombies mode is crazy! Its super addicting!! The multiplayer is awesome!! Everything about the game is amazing!! This is probably the last complete COD game for the Xbox 360[Black Ops 3 doesn't have any campaign for the 360]
