amazon service is good !! no doubt on that :D (5 stars)amazon service is good !! no doubt on that :D (5 stars)now about game :- single player is very good (5 stars) ,but multi-player is total waste (2 stars). i bought this game to play multi-player but after install(easy) when i connect to multi-player servers it cant connect to any servers, problem is that the key code is already used as it is very old game . as many players used pirated keygen so now this key code become nothing .and activision site has nothing to support about cod mw . so i successfully waste my 460 rupees. and as the key code is already used so amazon not replacing this item. so i request to all buyers think before buy this. and my another advice is this game does not need steam.(as steam is best for multi-player games because of Valve ). this game require punk-buster (you need to update from site after install). good luck have fun :) :)
