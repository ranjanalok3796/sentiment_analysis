The best game of its time and even if you play it now you are getting more than your money's worth!!!! If you are an ASSASSIN'S CREED series fan like me this is a must buy for you. You will get the same fun you that you will get in any assassin's creed game (overseeing AC Revelations and onwards) and if you only like very high graphics game think that it has graphics according to 2009 and see its price. It is an Excellent game overall and I repeat a must buy for AC series lover!
