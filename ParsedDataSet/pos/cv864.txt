Ull enjoy this game if u really like to do stuff and mess around in the open world.... The hacking just makes it better... And online multiplayer options are limited... There is no decryption and online free roam mode.... But the tailing, hacking and online races and ctos challenges are worth it.... Its a great game overall... :)
