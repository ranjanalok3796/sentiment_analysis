I was enjoying the game on my xbox but one day I just shared my xbox console it made the perfect scratch on my watch dogs disc 1.I am so worried how to fix it.I opened the game and get into a car and just start playing and it says the disc is unreadable try cleaning it with a soft cloth I am trying to solve this. Please don't shake your xbox 360 when your disc is in!!!!
