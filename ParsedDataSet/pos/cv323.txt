You can read lots of Review about Call of Duty: Ghosts so I will spare you that, its a good game no doubt there. (very short one though, when you will you feel you are just getting started it will end)Ordered it, got it before time as expected, it was sealed packed. Xbox did some 7GB update before launching it. Graphics looks cool on Xbox one. It has been quite some time since this game came out So I know this game disc will have no re-sale value (getting no offers on Olx). Once I am done with it it will kept in my old dusty movie/game disc collection.It was better if I purchased this digitally during Black Friday Deals in much cheaper which came later. I would suggest wait for a Deal to get games like this digitally if you have good Broadband Connection otherwise this is a great buy.
