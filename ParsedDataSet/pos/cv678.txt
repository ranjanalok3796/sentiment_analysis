Max Payne series is one of the best series that Rockstar games publishes. Well, I had great expectations of how the game play would turn out. Even with improved graphics, controls it was disappointing. The first 15 minutes unskippable cut scene, Unwanted movements, ridiculous health of the protagonist took the spark away. For a easy game play even in harder difficulty, simply enable the auto-aiming and you are done! Press and Hold LT then fire with RT and release both of the triggers. Repeat this as wanted. Story is somewhat interesting though. Hence my 4 stars out of 5 stars!
