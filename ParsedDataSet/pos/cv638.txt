Not reviewing the game here, addressing some of the concern people are having.No you don't need to download 38GB from Steam, you will be forced to if you activate directly in Steam but this can be easily avoided by using the included discs to install, just follow the Wizard.Another comment I saw was invalid key errors while validating to install, keep in mind there are 3 codes in the package. The "Steam Activation Key" is hidden behind the discs and is not easy to find, bizarre packaging flaw. The other two codes will be a SquareEnix registration code - just spam and a DLC code for some "Car Pack" or something like that, depending on when you actually buy it, the codes work just fine, none of the Arkham Knight mess here.Just so you know, you will need to download like 2GB from Steam after the Steam CD install, that's about it.
