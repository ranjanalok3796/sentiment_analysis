Average game . Story was same old revenge plot , gameplay was old felt like playing GTA Vice city(For example - A fall from 10 m will kill you and driving your car into the water also kills you and then an alligator eats you Huh that was new).Characters were all boring except Donovan man was cheery as hell.If this game costs Rs.2500 and Watchdogs cost Rs.930 then it's definitely screwing over customers(Literally).Average game .
