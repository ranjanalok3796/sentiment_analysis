Big thumbs up to Ubisoft, who just won't stop making awesome games and this game is an example of that. Awesome gameplay, fascinating story*line. Multi-player is decent too, laggy sometimes though. But the story-line will keep you interested till the end and you might get connected at the end, that sort of a game.
