I got this thing today and I fell in love with this game. The story is great and graphics are really looking great on my PS3 (I avoid comparing graphics with other platforms). Soon after you install the game, you have to install 22 parts of update as of 3rd April 2017 which are approximately 1.2GB in total. You can skip the installation of these updates, but you cannot use online features. If you're a first time PS3 user, it will take some time for getting used to the controls. Overall, the game is a must have if you own a PS3.
