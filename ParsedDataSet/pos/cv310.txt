The product I ordered for came before the estimated delivery date . It came on the 18th . Estimated was 22nd May . Problem is that the box came in dutch language but nevertheless the game can be installed in any language and most importantly the code for steam verification was right . The 4 dual layer DVDs and box were in perfect condition... Pleased with the price offer and the product because in the stores u still get this game for â‚¹4200 which is way too much. On pc the graphics are amazing... And storyline is interesting. To all those who criticize this game I think they should take their word back....
