It's a great game if your into First Person and a Far Cry Fan then you should go for it.. Since it's open world and set back in 10,000 B.C certain things could make it look lengthy as you have to collect items and craft them so if you don't craft your items well it could get tricky to complete this game.Over all good game probably 2nd best after Uncharted 4 - A Thiefs End.:)
