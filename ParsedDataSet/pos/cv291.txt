Finally Activision did a good job on the new CoD. Firstly the campaign was adrenaline pumping for the first time you play it. I would suggest you play in veteran in your first try. The campaign as usual is 6-7 hour long which only took me two night to finish. I was actually disappointed buy Activision on Ghosts.Multiplayer is DEAD!!!It says no games found on actual matchmaking and you can only play combat readiness program.No dedicated servers for this so that actually destroys multiplayer.Do not buy it for multiplayer and simply free download it from Utorrent for campaign.Also asusual you need steam for it and it does a 6.6 Gb update without which you cant playI'm only waiting for BO-3:3
