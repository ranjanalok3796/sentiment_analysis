Most advanced cricket game I have ever played so far, if you are gonna buy it, go for it. You will not regret. Such great graphics and the career mode will keep you eager to play more and more. Its so addicted and so realistic that will make you go crazy if you are a cricket lover. A perfect game, very well designed.You can only play with the game controller, the one which is given in the box is not that sensitive so if you can buy a better one will make the game controls better.It works absolutely great on Win 8.1.
