Damn it!Not a single bit of the actual game on the dvd! Just the installer! Gotta download the rest from steam. Curse you, steam! And thats 20 gb in all, just in case you are wondering.But that crap aside, lets talk about the game itself, the real thing, right? The real deal. So how is it?F***ING AMAZING!Yeah. But i dont think i need to convince you on that. It's everywhere.If you can handle that steam annoyance, buy it. Even if you cant, go for it nevertheless. Yes, its that good.
