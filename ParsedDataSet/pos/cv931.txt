I bought it then off of G2A and heres what I think-Owning a GTX1080, even on ultra settings(MSAA OFF) at 4K I am not able to get a smooth, visually pleasing game performance. Optimal was 1080P at 60FPS with MSAA ON.The game stutters occasionally.It is a not so challenging game and often too easy even with the most difficult of settings.No fast travel feature hence it can take ages traveling across the map for something like a 5 min objective and then back again to progress further.DO not buy the game unless you're a die hard Mafia fan. Wait for the prices to drop and then buy it as it isn't worth it just yet.I'd recommend a GTX 970 or higher for optimal game-play.
