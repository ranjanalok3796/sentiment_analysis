Other than not being able to jump,not able to melee attack unless prompted and not able to shoot while driving, this game is awesome!Despite people hating the protagonist Aiden Pearce,I actually think he's a decent protagonist.This game looks absolutely fantastic on PS4/Xbox One.PS3/Xbox 360/PC have decent graphics.I played this game on PS3 and for a 2006 console,this game looks pretty good.Don't listen to those who say ps3 and x360 graphics look s***ty,because it doesn't.Sure,this game fell just short of the hype,but a decent effort by Ubisoft.This game was different and good.You won't regret buying this now since the price has dropped.
