As a Metal Gear Solid game, Brilliant!! More ever released by the Developers for PC, even better!!I bought this 'DVD' without reading the seller Q&A, and yes this package is just a DVD to install Steam (which you can download from steam.com), and the Serial Key..The DVD does NOT contain the game- You still need to download the actual Game (20.3 GB) via Steam onto your PC to play.. So essential I waited for about a 6 days delivery time just to have a physical printed copy of my 'Steam key' delivered to me in a DVD case so that I can use that to 'begin' downloading the game from Steam.. Would have given 5 stars to the Seller if they had facility of emailing the key to us, after the purchase is verified so that we can get on with our business right after!Contents of the package-1) DVD (contain Steam setup and nothing else!)2) Printed Steam key (this is the sole content of the package that you made this purchase for)3) Advertisement pamphlet for some free on-line Piggyback guide to MGS 5Would have been nice, that considering we bought this physically and that it doesn't exactly contain the game, some value add material (brochure, booklet, OST CD, etc) could have been included
