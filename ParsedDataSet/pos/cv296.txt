Had ordered this game from "Beyond Toys And Gifts" Seller. Shipment happens from Bhiwandi, Maharashtra. and it was delivered in two days.Packing was decent but still few DVDs were out of it's place and had scratches due to that.Contains 6 DVDs and serial key. You must have Steam account in order to install this game. after the installation had to update ~13 GB in order to play the game. without the update you can't play the game.Game is heavy on the requirement side so if you are have slightly old PC, don't bother buying this game. Without the awesome graphics, it's just like any other game.MINIMUM:OS: Windows 7 64-Bit / Windows 8 64-Bit / Windows 8.1 64-BitProcessor: Intel® Core™ i3-530 @ 2.93 GHz / AMD Phenom™ II X4 810 @ 2.60 GHzMemory: 6 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTS 450 @ 1GB / ATI® Radeon™ HD 5870 @ 1GBDirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionHard Drive: 55 GB available spaceSound Card: DirectX CompatibleAdditional Notes: Field of View ranges from 65°-90°.RECOMMENDED:OS: Windows 7 64-Bit / Windows 8 64-Bit / Windows 8.1 64-BitProcessor: Intel Core i5-2500K @ 3.30GHzMemory: 8 GB RAMGraphics: NVIDIA® GeForce® GTX 760 @ 4GBDirectX: Version 11Network: Broadband Internet connectionHard Drive: 55 GB available spaceSound Card: 100% DirectX 9.0c Compatible 16-bit
