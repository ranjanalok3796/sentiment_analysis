Counter Strike Global Offensive is one of the most popular global multiplayer game. After CS 1.6 and CS source, Valve has released CSGO, and this game is awesome. The graphics has improved, you get better weapons, it has become more realistic. There are abundance of online players and valve servers are very good too. With a speed of over 1MBps, you can easily play CSGO online with friends accross the world. The network connection must be static and at least 3G speed. When the game runs, you should turn off all the downloading stuffs in the background or else your ping will falter and be very high.Counter Strike Global Offensive is one of the most popular global multiplayer game.

Two thumbs up for buying the game.But this come in CD format, i won't recommend to buy CD, purchase it directly from Steam, or purchase the CSGO code from Amazon. It's easy to redeem the code and get the game in your STEAM library. After adding the game to your library you just need to download and install the game files on the computer, it will start automatically. After that ready your gears and roll out in the world of chickens and dufuse kits... hehe ENJOY
