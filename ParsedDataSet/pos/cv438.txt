I got this game during the Google Online Shopping Festival 2014 for Rs.300 and it is a steal at that price. The game has beautiful graphics, huge open world, freedom, challenging enemies, an assortment of weapons and a good story.The most irritating part is installing the game. The box comes with 2 DVDs. It takes more than 30 mins to install from both DVDs. After this the DVD will install Uplay(needed to play Far Cry 3) after which it'll start updating Uplay after which you need to create a Uplay account(yay another account! Steam and Origin accounts weren't enough I suppose) and register the CD key to the account. Then when you finally try to launch the game it'll start updating the game(another 280MB) and then it finally lets you launch the game.The game takes about 2 mins to load even the main menu. If you don't have the latest drivers or if you are playing on a decent laptop, get ready for crappy performance. After updating to latest drivers, performance increased a lot. However I still get less than 30fps at lowest graphics possible even though I'm using my laptop at high performance and its overheating to 90C(I recently cleaned the laptop and used Arctic Silver thermal paste). I have AMD APU and GPU but still the game performs horribly.YOU ALSO HAVE TO BE CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET(BECAUSE EVERY ******* GAME NOWADAYS NEED 24x7 INTERNET CONNECTION FOR SOME ******* REASON). You can still play even if you are not connected but the ******* game keeps trying to connect to servers whenever you press Esc for main menu. WTF happened to the days when you could play games hassle free without needing a hundred accounts and being connected to the internet 24x7???If you have a good desktop or laptop and don't mind long installations then you're sure to enjoy this game throughout. I am really annoyed with the installation procedures.Update:I finally finished the game and am not too impressed with the second half of the story. Still worth playing though. The most irritating part is the loading time. Even with an Intel quad core desktop processor and Nvidia GTX 750Ti, it takes more than a minute to launch the game and load the main menu. It takes some time even to load a saved game. If you are not connected to the internet the stupid game will still try to connect to servers every time you press Esc for menu.
