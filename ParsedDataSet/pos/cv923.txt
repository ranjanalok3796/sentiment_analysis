Those idiots who rate games 1* or 2* saying it's steam version,keep your mouth shut ,who wants to pile up all discs and loose the games when we get a scratch on DVD? Who wants to insert the disc every now and then to play a game? And who wants to stack 100s of DVDs on ur self and kill time searching for a game cd u want to play for that movement? Or who wanna play the whole game again if you don't have a cloud save feature like the one that steam offers?ABOUT GAME-its cool game and is for those destruction fans!though it's from dirt series,it has nothing to do with other dirt games.super quality graphics on ultra setting and stunning camera angles make it evenmore enjoyable!
