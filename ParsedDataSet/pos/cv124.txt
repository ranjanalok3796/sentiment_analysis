fantastic game, ubisoft has surely realized all its mistake and has improved it like-1) the free roam in the previous game was a bit boring. now you are a captain of a ship so you roam around the carriben seas. if you don't like sailing a ship you may fast travel if the location is discovered.2) the story line which was in assassin creed 3 was a bit complicated, you would have to play it twice to understand so now they have made it a simple and sweet storyline.3) in the previous assassins game there were only contracts on (land) as you were only in one location but now you also have navy contracts.4)the graphics are improved.that's all the improvement in the game and there may be some more but you reading this review from a assassins creed fan for sure.
