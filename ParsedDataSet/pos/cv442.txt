As far as games for PS3 go, it's competitively priced. The SP campaign has a good, decent length, and features a notorious Final Boss: Vaas. Vaas proves himself to be crazy as hell early in the game, and hovers like a shadow throughout the campaign. Mos Def's character (can't think of him as anything else) is great, and I won't spoil a surprise regarding his role.Features a good array of weapons, great topography and well designed AI for enemies. Unlike FC2, enemies don't seem to respawn. One advise: Try it at hard settings or else it might be too easy.Graphics are pretty good, and remind you of Creed: Black Flag or Tomb Raider.
