First, Terrific packing and delivery by Amazon. Ordered through Amazon Prime and damn it was spot on.Coming to the game, I'm a solid Metal gear fan. Love this one a lot. Lot's of people complain about the story, but I feel that the game makes up for it in the gameplay. And the world, OMG! it's so huge and fun.Will update once I finish the game
