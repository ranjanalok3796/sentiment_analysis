Game is astonishingly beautiful.. I was not at all aware of metal gear solid saga before this game was out.. but now I am a big fan. I have completed about 10% of the game even after spending good 30 hours. The thing I liked most about this game is how the characters are shaped. You feel engaged & responsible while playing the game & there is an additional responsibility of managing your base too.In short, this game is a package of excellent nonlinear gameplay, interesting story & characters. Probably a best open world game of the year.
