Best cricket game ever. The graphics are very nice and gameplay is excellent. At Rs.1400 its completely worth it since it comes with a controller too. I cant personally comment on the quality of the controller since i use the xbox controller, but it looks ok. If you are looking for a good cricket game then just go for it. Also to be noted is the point that this is not a licensed product, but you can download the squads with proper player and team names.Best cricket game ever.
