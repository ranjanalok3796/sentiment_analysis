With a very short campaign, which lasted mere 5 hours, this game has a wonderful storyline, but fails to engage a player due to the short duration. Ghosts are supposed to be masters in stealth, but very often you find yourself in the middle of the battle, all guns blazing. Biggest let off is that it doesn't support more than 2 player split screen!! With a good arsenal of modes and maps, Multiplayer is good. The other good things about the game are then new Extinction and Squads mode.This has proven to be the most disappointing. If you're looking for a stealth game try Splintercell Blacklist, Ghosts is not meant for stealth.
