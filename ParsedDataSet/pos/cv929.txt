The game :The game :Pros:1) The story. PERIOD. No other reason is needed to buy this game.2) Setting. The game is set in the 60s and they have captured the time period quite well. Plus they've captured the racial tension at the time quite well. And yes, you can kill some KKK members.3)Shooting and driving feels violently satisfying. Hearing the roar of American muscle while you shoot some random gangsters with your Tommy gun, priceless!4)Vito is back and boy does it feel good to see an old face! Yes, Joe's disappearance is explained.5)The massive open world is just so pretty to look at.The cons:1) As much as I hate to say it, this game is a s***ty console port and is plagued with numerous graphical bugs. 30 fps cap, blurry/muddy look etc. Patches have removed the frame limit, but even still people with gtx 1080s are barely touching 60fps. My recommendation is to run the game at 30 fps.2)Before you can get to a story mission, you have to do these repetitive mini-missions, which is pretty much rinse and repeat.3)The world is not as immersive as mafia 2, remember opening windows, shoe shining, buying food from a hot dog vendor, changing clothes, customizing your vehicle? These are simply not there in mafia 3. However, the game developers have promised to release an update allowing you to customize your characters clothes in the near future.The package : 6 dvds, one key for the game, one key for the pre-order dlc and a massive map of New Bordeaux. After installing the game you'll still have to sit and install 6GB from steam, esp because 2 patches have been released for the game.VERDICT: If a story is more important to you, more important than 60fps then buy the game. I know it's not great, especially in 2016, but trust me it won't spoil your experience.7/10. - 3 for the optimization issues, I was really looking forward to playing this and they let my expectations down.
