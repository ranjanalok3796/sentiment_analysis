I am giving 4 stars to this because of the price on Amazon. At 999 also the game is worth every penny spend but I bought the game from steam for just 149 during the winter sale. Without the sale also the price is only 499. Now about the game I give it a 11/10 . Just mind blowing .I want to become a hacker now after playing the game.I had no problem with driving.Its a bit easy since I play a lot of NFS and others. The story is also good.I recomend every one to buy this game. A lot of things are there to do without getting bored. But shooting is a bit tough but it doesn't matter.I think it beat GTA 5 in the run.But GTA 5 I think graphics is a little better. I get about 65 fps with my gtx 750 to and 4 GB ram
