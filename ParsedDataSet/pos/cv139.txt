It's been a long while since I last played Batman games (Dark Tomorrow, Vengeance, Rise of Sin Tzu). I was apprehensive about getting this one as the continuity will be lost quickly with Arkham Knight being next-gen only. But I wanted to see why Arkham Origins characters were so much over-powered on the Injustice mobile game. Also, a lot of reviews mention that only the boss fights were significant improvements over Rocksteady's Arkham games. But, hey, I never played those games.The story is just... well it's the story of Batman and is just what it should be. Though I haven't tried it yet, there is a DLC covering the origin story as well. Brawling mechanics are eased up a lot. This is a relief for me, not having touched brawlers in a while. Experienced players might find the fights too easy. And, may be I'm playing it wrong but stealth did not seem to work very well for me.Crime scene investigations look great but there is a serious lack of need for player's decision making here (would have been awesome if the story is effected by player's decision making like it does in The Wolf Among Us or any other Telltale game series). Similarly, more could have been done with Cryptographic Desequencer.Very disappointing things though, are, lack of variation in objectives (yes, there are tiny puzzles around the collectibles but they are just not enough) and a vast but empty city - seriously, Batman is fighting for justice, but justice for who? The only people you see around who are not thugs are hostages.Overall, I give this game an 8.5/10. Yes, there is a lot of scope for improvement in terms of gameplay and presentation. Yes, there is going to be a lack of continuity on old-gen consoles. But most of what I'm looking for in a Batman game is the story and there's plenty of that in this game.EDIT: Just realized Arkham Knight continues 1 year after where Arkham City left off. In any case, future of Arkham Origins is uncertain.
