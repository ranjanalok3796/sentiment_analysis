What you are seeing is Advanced Warfare", Something that Kevin Spacey had said during the beginning of the campaign that made the whole game sound badass, but the whole focus here is on the multiplayer that would have players play for countless hours. The Supply drops are interesting to receive, since you wouldn't know what 3 items could be inside, an easy way to exploit your way into getting one is to quickly get yourself killed at the start of any game mode match which is odd, since it works every time.The graphics are good, it was just not my main focus when I was playing this game or it just didn't stand out to me to start taking a screenshot every sec. The sound, some guns sounded great while some just sounded a bit weak.What is making this game for me fun? The Exo movement, it was a much notable function that was more then what I was expecting. You could dash on the ground or while in the air in any direction or slam down on an enemy. While in the match it just feels funs jumping and dashing everywhere to kill other people doing the same thing, it's pretty arcadey, which I like.There are no kill streaks, It's now called score streaks. It's when you gather enough points for your uav or something. There are not that many since you can now instead upgrade your score streak in multiple ways, like for the Uav you can have it last longer and/or send it orbital where it can't be shot down and/or have it detect where enemies are pointing and much more. It would cost the streak more, but it would make it a lot better, so it actually happens to have more score-streaks then you may have thought. A feature that I happen to appreciate highly, since it rewards for those who support or just follow the objectives.Pick 13, not sure if that was a good decision, but it does work well. You can remove your score streaks for more points or add another one, which is nice.Good Job Sledge Hammer, you managed to create a CoD that's fun to play
