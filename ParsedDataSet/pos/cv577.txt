Map, storyline, characters, activities , trains, everything is good. Right now i completed 10% game still many things need to discover.Best thing about ps4 is you can play as first person move .Compare to pc , it only have 1 disc while pc having 7 discs and 5 GB update.The only con i found is you need to download 8gb update to play online, extra features, social club. Etc . for story mode just install and play.
