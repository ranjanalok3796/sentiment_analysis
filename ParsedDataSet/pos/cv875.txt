The game gets repetitive after the first few missions. All you have to do is hack into stuff on the CTOS network. I thought it would be like GTA V with hacking, but I was terribly disappointed. You'll like the game just as a casual means to get away from daily life, but if you're a serious gamer, I'd advise you to stay away from this title.
