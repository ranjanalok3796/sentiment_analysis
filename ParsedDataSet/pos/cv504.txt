Excellent Game but I have a GEFORCE GTX 610 a 2GB Graphic Card and Intel i5 with 8GB Ram but Farcry Primal Runs very slow on it and gets stuck in a certain place during a mission I don't know why???? Can someone help me with that because it's a nice Game after all that I am still anxiously waiting to play without any lag
