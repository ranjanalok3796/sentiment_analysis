Format: Blu-ray|Verified PurchaseThe Amazing Spider-Man 2 (3D)Probably the Best Spider-Man movie in Sound, Video and Blu-Ray Packing I have seen till now. The Movie is also good and fun to pass your time on weekends with family.The Amazing Spider-Man 2 swings onto Blu-ray with a brilliant DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 lossless soundtrack. This is a classic new movie audio presentation. Everything performs seamlessly and in total harmony: music, effects, ambience, dialogue, the whole nine yards. Musical notes are smooth and nicely spaced across the front. Speakers seem to melt away in favor of the beautifully harmonious presentation that's aided by the perfect balance of surround support and low end pronouncement, whether light score, heroic trumpets, or heavy electronic-inspired beats.Dialogue is nicely produced through the center, including Electro's deeper, scratchier voice. Overall, this is a showstopper of a soundtrack that's everything it should be, and then some.Credits:BluraydotcomFirst 10 minutes of the movie is good Demo Material to showoff your HTS...
