The gameplay will feel a wee bit repetitive if you already have played another games in this franchise but overall it's a new experience as the game is set in 10000BC, graphics are great and runs flawlessly even on my mid end gaming laptop and as expected of Amazon got it 3 days before the delivery date.Give it a go and you won't regret it.
