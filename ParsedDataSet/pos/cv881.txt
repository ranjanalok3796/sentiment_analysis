Nt completed the game...so this review wnt be bout the story....the overall gameplay is gr8... its easy to get accustom in combat if u have played splinter cell ...nd the hacking mechanism is easy nd makes sense most of the time... the story missions are great...but I am addicted to its multiplayer...especially free roam...most things are taken frm gta 5....but if u really want to enjoy this game...my advice is dnt compare it to gta 5... although the world is not as vast as gta 5 ...but evry thing is detailed ...graphics are amazing on ps4 nd slighly better than high on pc .. fps hardly ever drops nd is quit smooth.. overall great game...but most probably nt the best game of 2014
