I have played almost all the latest games uncharted 4, witcher 3, GTA 5 etc etc. This game is the best it has 50 main missions and 157 side missions and infinite possibilities to complete them. This game is for the intelligent gamer. No other game comes close to this. This one and witcher 3 are your best bets if you want to buy a open world game. Hideo kojima is a rock star and he proves it again.
