awesome game , very good graphics , very good. Dont get this game if u have an LCD tv , it will spoil the fun . Singleplayer mode is very good and good tasks , not that tough either , love the hacking part and stuff , and the profiling random people. Isnt like gta V u dont get to go running around shooting people . ur a good guy in this. Multiplayer isn't recommended in the ps3. Ps4 Must Buy
