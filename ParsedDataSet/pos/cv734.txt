Yet another brilliant game by Hideo Kojima and his team. This games takes the open-world sandbox style gameplay that most games today have, there is tons of things to do and explore. The game offers great replay value, I've played around 36 hours and still at around 25% completion. My only complaint is with the re-use of the maps and locations for the side missions. That just feels like you're replaying the side missions over and over again. Game AI is brilliant and difficulty is pretty forgiving for most players, graphics is good and performance is decent at Max settings.
