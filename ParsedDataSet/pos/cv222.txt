I Am now going to check out MW2.To get it short and straight , if your PC meets the minimum specs get this game straight away without any question doesn't matter if u love CoD or not. It's worth every penny and is a must play game for any gamer.The single player campaign is just awesome. U wouldn't ask for anything better.I guarantee u that The multiplayer will be loads of fun. Doesn't matter whether u like playing online or not , whether u have played online or not , u have to check it out. I am someone who didn't play any online multiplayer game before and I didn't look for multiplayer in games as I thought it wasn't my cup of tea and didn't interest me. After playing for quite some time I decided to try out multiplayer for the first time in my life, and I got hooked to it the very first minute even though I got smoked out by others on the first day. Since then I left the single player campaign midway and I play only multiplayer on this now, it's so much fun. After some time , I play decent at online and the keeps getting bigger and bigger as u improve. It's hard to keep it down.
