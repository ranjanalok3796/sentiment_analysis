Format: DVD|Verified PurchaseMy hopes and expectations were incredibly high for The Amazing Spider-Man 2. I was actually a little nervous going into this one. Lots of sequels have disappointed me over the years, but this was not one of them. Director Marc Webb's follow up was way better than the first Amazing Spider-Man film, and it might just be better than any of the Spider-Man films that Sam Raimi made. I'm going to have to rewatch them just to make sure, but as of right now I believe that it is.The action in the movie was insane and extremely fun to watch. One of my favorite aspects of the action was how the hero of the story kept a sense of humor and cracked jokes throughout some of the fight sequences. Some of those scenes were very heavy, and it was just nice to have Spidey crack a joke every now and then to lighten the mood a bit. Of course, there are some events that take place that Spider-Man has to take seriously. If you were hoping to see some great action in the movie, then you'll be happy to know that it's there.
