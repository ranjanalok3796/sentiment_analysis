this game is same as the other two games previous to this... doesnt feel different at all... u r lead straight away into combat... not much story build up... but the game is enjoyable... make sure to buy an extra controller along with the game dvd... the buttons are going to be squashed quite hard especially during boss fight (death stroke fight in particular)...i got the game at a discounted rate... got all the dlcs wit it... whch u wil hv to download frm net by redeeming the dlc codes...amazon service is top notch as usual...buy the game only if u r a batman fan... if u hv played the previous arkham asylum and arkham city... u wont miss anythng by not buying ths game...
