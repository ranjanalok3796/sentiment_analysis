Platform for Display: PC|Edition: Standard|Verified PurchaseIntroduction on patch 1.5 has changed the game. With the introduction of the world tiers, there is no need to go to the Dark Zone for good loot. Only problem is when the host connection is poor. Make sure that you have stable connection. Amazing game.
