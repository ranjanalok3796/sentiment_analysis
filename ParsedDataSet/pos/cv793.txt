THIS GAME IS ONE OF THE BEST IN SERIES,BUT HAS A CON COMING WITH IT IF YOU ARE BUYING RETAIL DISK.WHEN YOU BUY RETAIL A RETAIL DISK YOU EXPECT THAT ALL THE GAME CONTENT GET TO YOU LOADED INTO DVDS BUT WHEN YOU WILL RECEIVE THE COPY OF THIS GAME YOU ONLY GET A SINGLE DVD CONTAINING LESS THAN 1.5 GB'S GAME CONTENT AND THE REST OF THE GAME YOU WILL HAVE TO DOWNLOAD FROM STEAM AND THE SIZE YOU HAVE TO DOWNLOAD IS AROUND 33 GB'S.THIS WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM IF WE ARE LIVING IN SOME WESTERN COUNTRY WERE THEY HAVE TO PAY $20( Rs 1200 ) FOR 25 MB UNLIMITED INTERNET.BUT WE ARE LIVING IN INDIA WHERE FOR 1 Mb INTERNET PLAN WHICH GIVE DOWNLOAD SPEED OF 128 KB/S WE HAVE TO PAY RS 1200.WE THIS SUCKY SPEED IT TOOK ME MORE THEN 80 HR'S TO GET THIS GAME IN TO MY PC,AD GUESS WHERE DO I LIVE ,I LIVE AT NEW DELHI WHICH IS UNFORTUNATELY CAPITAL OF INDIA.SO UNLESS YOU ARE SOME RICH MAN WHO CAN AFFORD A NET PLAN WHICH DOWNLOADS THIS GAME IN LESS THAN 10 HR'S(BECAUSE AFTER 10 HR'S SEEING THIS THING GETTING DOWNLOAD WILL BE VERY FRUSTRATING) MY OPINION IS NOT TO GO FOR IT.
