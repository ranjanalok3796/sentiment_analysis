This is a game by Hideo Kojima and where Kojima is involved that project is surely worth checking.Metal Gear Solid V is no exception. Though one needs to download the whole game from Steam, in long run that is a good thing. The game can be stored in external drive for future use.As per gameplay matters ,it is very detailed and almost realistic. It contains dynamic day-night circle,dynamic weather simulation and also enemy AI is pretty good.Enemies will react to players' tactics and will force players to take different approach every time.Though it is a stealth game ,players can go loud any time except certain mission and it does not affect the ratings in game.However blowing things may lead to less resources.I will suggest to play it at once.P.S.:The story is not a strong suit of this game however presentation and gameplay will make up for that.
