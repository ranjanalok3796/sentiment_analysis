I have played FarCry 3, I have not played FarCry 4. Now I am playing this game. It is simply on the another level and is different from others in FarCry series. Graphics is awesome. Gameplay is awesome if you are going for main missions. But for that you need to have many important skills like taming of beasts and weapons like bee cluster (kind of work like a Granade). Overall best game in FarCry series. Still FarCry 3 is on higher ratings.
