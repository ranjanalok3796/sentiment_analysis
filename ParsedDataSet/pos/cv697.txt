It's good to be back in the shoes of Payne. The character is exactly as I remember but the game is not. It's not gloomy enough. The tragedy is not enough to make Max what he was in Max Payne 1 and 2.Regardless the games is awesome with some kickass action sequences and also bullet time. Must play game. Totally had fun while playing it.
