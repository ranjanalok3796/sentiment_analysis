Wanted to give 5 stars but it's online is below the games dignity. It's bad to experience such a bad service from ubisoft to playstation 3 users. Watchdogs taked 4 years to be fully completed and when it launched ( no multiplayer free online mode ) is present in the game. This makes me little unsatisfied otherwise the graphics and gameplay is very amazing.
