Just cause 3! More like Just mayhem 3!The game is just amazing in terms of open world gameplay and the visuals are just stunning. The fictional island of Medicci is one of the most beautiful world's in a game.Contrary to what I've heard, the loading times aren't bad,2 mins at max. I did experience some bugs but they weren't severe. And the online logging in can be tedious at times. But these are the only things wrong with this incredible game.This a must play and will offer hours of explosive gameplay.
