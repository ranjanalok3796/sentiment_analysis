Now onto the game -The gameplay was amazing , at first i wasnt really interested in buying ,but all of a sudden it got really hyped . I wanted to try this out myself and wasnt dissapointed , it looked a lot like destiny , but there are differences , the story and character buildup could have been a lot better , took me 35hrs to complete story missions and reach lv 30 but this is where real fun starts so keep on playing . Make sure you have stable internet connection buying and it does have many upgrades prior you can play it . So kep that in mind . Other than that it is a must play .
