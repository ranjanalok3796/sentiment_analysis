The game is made in prehistoric time scale and is beaitifully done. The animations of many vital things are dine beautifully. Tame beasts and ride them. Use of environment is the best thing of this game. Save your people and build your village is a nice concept. Overall the game is very good and Ubisoft has made it masterfully. Enjoyable and addictive, the game turns on your thinking power to analyze and find solution to various things in the game world
