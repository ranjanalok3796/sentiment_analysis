This is my first game of the far cry series and it's a good game. U start as takkar gathering resources and bringing together the wenja tribe. There are other rival tribes called the udam and the izila. We can take over the outposts one by one until we reach the final boss character. Overall is a polished game and u will have fun playing it ! Thanks for reading 👍🏻 btw I got it for the Xbox one if u are wondering !
