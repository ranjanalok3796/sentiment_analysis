Mortal Kombat X offers the best story mode I've ever personally seen in a fighting game. Its cohesive plot and extended cinematics makes you feel much more like a participant in a film than a player on the couch. The fighting is frantic, fluid, and dynamic, with the glorious goriness of the X-Ray moves often turning the tides of battle.An absolute must for franchise fans, and a really stellar bet for general fighting game fans, even those who just appreciate a good story will find a lot to love in Mortal Kombat X.
