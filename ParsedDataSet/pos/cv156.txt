I never have enough time to write reviews. So I am going to keep it short. The product was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. So there's nothing much to say about Amazon's service except that it is excellent. They need to keep it up and not slack off.About the game itself I will just say that it isn't as good as Arkham City but it's not totally bad either. But beware, it has a lot of bugs - some of them potentially 'game-breaking'. So research this angle before buying.The serial key of the game is to be redeemed on Steam. The box contains three discs.
