After which it will download 5 to 6 GB of game and then updates of around 1 GB.Don't buy it. Better alternative, install Steam online anyways it is free. Pay amount via steam and download. Same result.Why? Buying this disc won't register as Steam purchase. Thus few features of Steam will not be unlocked like Friend invites and Community market. Buying it via Steam will activate those features by default.
