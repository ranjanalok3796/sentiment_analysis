This was one game which I was waiting eagerly to get my hands on. Once I got it finally to my horror you had download the entire 35 GB of game in 29 parts adds to that a recently released patch of 15.8 GB. Since this is India & not US where there is allowance of much liberal internet usage- a fact which the developers could have taken into account. This humongous download was a big let letdown even if you can play the game with limited capabilities till the rest of the files are downloaded in background. Make no mistake the game is superbly designed & fun to play but on PC platform it does come with it's baggage of problems
