This game is great i did not buy it from amazon i purchased a gtx 970 and then i go to nvidia to redeem code of the phantom pain.steam servers are great on my mobile internet was between 400-600kbps but connected to steam i got 1.6MBPS maximum and 700kbps minimum.i started the download at 12:30 at midnight and when i got up 6:30 i saw game is downloaded and when i play the game the story is amazing.a must buy game if you have any console or pc.
