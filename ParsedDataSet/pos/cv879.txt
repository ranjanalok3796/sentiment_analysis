This game borrows many elements from Splinter Cell, Assassin's Creed and GTA. Though there are some parallels, it feels much like Splinter Cell and Assassin's Creed than GTA. It differs from GTA by a great deal in the tone of the story, the way the story is told and how it is executed.Watch Dogs has a lengthy campaign with a not so interesting story set to a Assassin's Creed like tone with a gameplay style that makes you feel like you are playing an open-world version of Splinter Cell sans Sam Fisher. Hacking sets it apart from the aforementioned games. Besides adding new kind of weapons to the catalog, it let's you plan the execution for achieving the objective. It's also a bit boring if you had any background in computer security. You don't get to fish for vulnerabilities and be clever in so many ways after all. Also, it feels like Watch Dogs doesn't explore the vigilantism part as much as it should.The open world elements is another place where the game differs significantly from GTA V. You don't get to do much in Watch Dogs. Mini-games are a great value add though (esp. NVZN). I haven't explored the multiplayer part of the game at this point.Overall, Watch Dogs gets positive points for Splinter Cell like variety, original ideas like hacking and vigilantism, mini-games and mechanics. And negative points for uninteresting story, not so useful open world and undeveloped ideas. That would put it at 8/10.
