This game has come a long way from previous Just Cause games. The world (which is Medici,Italy) seems a lot more bigger and interactive than JC2. The story is not bad either. You have to liberate many bases, cities, outposts etc. You can drive anything from sports cars to tanks and fighter jets. The missions are repetitive. This game can get over very fast. But if you are looking for a shooter game, you must definitely buy it.
