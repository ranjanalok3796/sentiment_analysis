Kudos to Amazon for fast delivery and packaging.Coming to the game we get a CD which is of no use and a steam code which can activated online on steam client.Tried couple of times to run CD but it wasn't installing game.. Finally had to download whole game of 6.4GB from steam. It took nearly 2hrs on my Internet connection to download game.#PROS:1.Game has now lot details and high end graphics which is definitely gonna be liked by all.2.Plenty of steam add on's#CONS:1.If you're used to play Counter strike source alot... Then u'll find bit difficult to handle guns in this edition. U've to be more precise and accurate with your targets.2.Needs very good Internet connection.Conclusion :This is an awesome game and all gaming freaks shouldn't miss this.. I'm totally in love with it.. And spending my holidays on it day and night :)Don't wait, just buy it.
