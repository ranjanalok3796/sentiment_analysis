So I've bought this game directly off steam and here are my impressions.After playing all the FarCry series games and a true admirer of Ubisoft I must say that this game at first may sound a little boring.FPS itself describes itself as First Person Shooter but there is no shooting just throwing clubs, hitting with clubs and occasional archery.Nevertheless the game doesn't lose it's appeal. Why?The story line is breathtaking. The scenes are phenomenal.I'm still in the early stages of the game with roughly 2 hours of game play time.I will update this review as I go ahead.And the experience will be superior on PC as it is a FPS game and you have more flexibility in terms of graphics and when you have a super hot rodded rig like mine you won't look at that console which is actually gathering dust behind my TV.FARCRY PRIMAL ‚ù§
