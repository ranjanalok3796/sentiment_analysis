Nabbed a copy of Ghosts from Amazon for as low as 399 rupees a couple of months back. Amazon didn't disappoint. The delivery was completed well and truly before the last date. So completely satisfied with the service.Coming to the game now. Not only one of the most underrated CODs but also one of the most underrated games ever.Pros-1. Campaign is unique and engaging2. Solid and diverse gameplay3. Multiplayer soldier customization coupled with the Squads mode are nice inclusions.4. Wide range of dynamic maps designed to suit the style of all types of players5. Extinction mode is Ubercool. Justifies the title in the truest sense of it.6. Last but not the least, special mention has to go to the unsung hero Riley.Cons-1. Campaign is a bit short2. Riley, the dog, was very much underused. It, too some extent, detracted from the overall experience.3. Graphics is not too impressive even when maxed out.4. Optimization is not quite good.5. Cannot check out the ping or network strength.6. Some maps have become the playground of hackers. Should be duly noted and accordingly banned.P.S- This review is entirely unbiased.
