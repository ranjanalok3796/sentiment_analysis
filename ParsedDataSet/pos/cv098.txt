The game's very good and if you don't believe me see the other reviews and you will know and don't believe the 1 star reviews as they are just frustrated the game didn't work on their pc as the game requires high graphics, fast processor and high ram to work in full resolution. The game has many weapons like the previous Ac3 game and interesting and adventurous main missions and side missions like naval contracts, assassin contracts, underwater exploring,etc. which are amazing. And if that's not enough you can explore the whole Caribbean sea with the Jackdaw and fight and hunt down ships, board them for fun and use the resources obtained for upgrading the Jackdaw or including it to our own fleet of ships and there are many islands for us to explore. The game's story is strong and very finely detailed and will keep you hooked to it until it gets completed. The present day story is not so much interesting and the only reason Ubisoft kept it was to continue the present day story of the previous games. The only thing you will find a little interesting is hacking computers of the other abstergo employees. And back in the main game the most important Thing is that is it has been rated as the best pirate game ever made so its recommended for you to buy it and a must for every assassin's creed series lover.
