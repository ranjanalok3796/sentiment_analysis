Far cry 3 is far better than 1 and 2. Lot of improvements in terms of graphics and game playing objective.If you love violence then this is a game that gives you lot more to enjoy.Work very well with 512MB graphics card and 2GB of RAM.Installation is pretty straight but after installing the game - it is controlled by Uplay which would ask you to update recent patches released (may be 5 patches ). No issues found on game performance.When you play in offline mode, it would check for connecting to server each time when you press ESC button (bit annoying but ok).Lot more side objectives are there apart from main missions so this game might take longer days to complete.
