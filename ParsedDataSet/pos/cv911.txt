This game is no longer available for purchase on Steam but the retail key included with the DVD still activates the game on Steam. It was previously available for free from HumbleBundle sometime in Jan 2017 and it had its last sale on 25th Feb 2017 at 90% off for Rs. 47. It was then removed due to some licensing issue.This game is no longer available for purchase on Steam but the retail key included with the DVD still activates the game on Steam.

I also don't see any region restriction on playing the game from outside India during travel.
