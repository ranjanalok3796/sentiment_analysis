Didnt purchase it from Amazon but im here to write a review. This game is just excellent. If you people are thinking about changing from serious games like MGS V and Fallout 4 then go for this one. Im a huge Jc2 fan and this is no different. It got even bigger, better and badder. Just ignore the story, it might be weak for some as Just Cause is only meant for causing the destruction and mayhem throughout the game. This is the game where you can do anything your creativity. Having a huge blast playing this after weeks of serious gaming from MGS 5, Fallout 4 and The Witcher 3. Yes, like mentioned everywhere, all platforms suffer performance issues with Xbox One being the worst.... I've ps4 version and i can definitely say that this is completely playable albeit the load times can be abit longer ( which can be 2mins at the max) but still can be ignored and almost all the bugs are solved after updating the day one patch which stands at whooping 2.58gbs..Kudos to Avelanche for such an excellent gameEDIT : Load times has been decreased ( as mentioned in the changelog) after recent update deployed by the developers
