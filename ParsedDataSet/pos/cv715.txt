First of excellent delivery speed and quality (good job amazon) and secondly no u dont need to download anything for playing the game on A console.As for the game, konami is going to cry rivers for letting kojima go. The game is best described in one word.Epic.The gameplay style and the multiple ways of achieving your goals is amazing. And the ooen world of Kabul and the Angola Zaire Border Region are juet breathtaking.My best buy of december 2015
