Guys this is a wonderful looking game on pc and well optimized one too. U would have to download just about 850MB of the day 1 patch which is actually quite fine unlike the unoptimized Batman arkham knight pc version. The gameplay though quite similar to far cry 3 and far cry 4 is great but it is not exactly the same. The bow and arrow and the spears were great. The only con that i felt ,which is also mentioned in most of the reviews, is the inability to dodge or side step when fighting in close combat. Hope they release a patch where that could be made possible.I dont know why it has mixed ratings on steam. But if u are a a far cry fan then this is something u definitely must check.
