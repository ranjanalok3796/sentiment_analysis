I was very much surprised to see only 1 DVD in the Box. During installation, i was clear that we need to download entire game through Steam. Initially it downloaded 3GB. Now it is downloading 29 Game Parts individually each like 400-500mb sized. What is the use of purchasing DVD if are made to download the entire game? Pathetic Game Developers. Nothing wrong with Amazon. As always, Seller and Delivery duration both were satisfactory.
