First of all this game requires 4gb space on your xbox hard drive to run, so this game won't run on the 4gb xbox 360s. You must have the xbox hard drive to be able to run this game.Best COD Game till date. The graphics on the xbox 360 still feel like modern warfare 2. The multiplayer is the main key... Improved than the black ops 2, much faster and definitely better than ghosts. The campaign is full of awesome moments that make u feel like a bada**
