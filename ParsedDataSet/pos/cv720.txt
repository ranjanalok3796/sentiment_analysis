Just a heads up. The disc only contains an 8MB Steam installer. As per tradition (as that is what it seems to be with modern Steamworks games) you'll have to download all of the game data from Steam itself which amounts to a staggering 28GB. My review is for the game itself as I already have the game on Steam. If you can afford to download the game then it definitely is a must buy. It's Metal Gear. What more can I say.
