The Product required Steam engine update which was around 200 mb but took a lot of time due to steam engine crashing in between the update.After 2 hours of steam update the game took another 1.5 hour to install. After installation the game required an update of 2.5 GB.Phew finally after 5 hours I was able to play the game. The game is like all the previous COD series but net better than Black ops 2.Cool graphics but not as good as a Battlefield. Buy it if you are a COD fan like me.
