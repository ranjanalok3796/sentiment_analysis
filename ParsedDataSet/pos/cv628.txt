The game easily deserves a 3 star rating since the gameplay is smooth... The graphics are immersion and the storyline is somewhat modern with a touch of nature and detour... Equipped with a grappling hook a parachute and a wingsuit u needn't think twice before jumping.. While I feel this game is a little high priced for the story is small and it gets monotonous after some time.. There are better games out there.. But if u only wanna play this for the gadgets and the fun of shooting then this is the game for you
