Its the First Chapter of the Arkham Origins Series. Till Date Playing the title & found that it is vast as compared to Batman Arkham City. But the Story Part is short as far as compared to Batman Arkham Origins. I Received Two DLCs in Pack that are Knightfall Download & Deathstroke challenge Pack. An Immersive Title to be engaged.
