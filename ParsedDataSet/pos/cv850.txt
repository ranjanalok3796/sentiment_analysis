It's one of the best Ubisoft games I found till now according to me(best Assassin's creed Black Flag). Good graphics, great main character- Aiden Pearce, Great time pass things to do (which matters the most in a game.) Great story, Good things to do with hacking(creating huge disasters, accidents, invading someone's personal space). But i have to say its kinda like GTA+ Hacking- Many cool GTA features+ Many cool Watchdogs features. But over all it makes for a great game and deserves 5 stars right away. Can't wait for Watchdogs' and Assassin's creed's sequel.
