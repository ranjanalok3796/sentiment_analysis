Platform for Display: PC|Edition: StandardThis is by far the most biggest game by ubisoft. And game looks crisp and fluid. Only one annoying part is there are 5 expansion pack for this game, at start you get only Manhattan area unlocked. And there are DLC for gears, maps and other content. Overall enjoyable game. Must buy to enjoy online content and play along with your friends to complete the mission esp. In dark zones.
