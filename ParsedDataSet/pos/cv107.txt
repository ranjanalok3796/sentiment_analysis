This is the most amazing game i have ever played. Fantastic graphics, amazing story, its like living history. Sailing across seas in the Caribbean, fighting on land and sea is really really breath taking. I was expecting it like ac3 but its totally different, really really good. The night time sail, tail and kill looks so cool. I have high end pc so graphics were smooth all across the game at 1080p, 27inch 144hz. Best game ever. Crysis and every other fps stands no where near this game.
