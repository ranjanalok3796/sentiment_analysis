Platform for Display: PC|Edition: StandardThe division is a pretty good game. It's a bit monotonous though(you'll love the dark zone though, trust me). Intense graphics and 's good gaming engine. And u DON'T need an "awesome" Internet connection to run this game. 100kbps download speed is enough. Make sure that the ping is good, though. Great work, ubisoft. Oh, also....u need to riddle an enemy with a LOT of bullets to kill him....happy gaming....
