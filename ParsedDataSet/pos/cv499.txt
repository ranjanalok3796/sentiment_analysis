I've been a fan of Far Cry since Far Cry 2 and h ave to say that this is a breath of fresh air in the series and one that was overdue. The stone age setting is new terrain and Far Cry does this really well. At the start of the game, you feel really vulnerable when you're out exploring and coming across a few beasts that will tear you limb from limb with only a stick and stone to defend yourself. An hour in and the beast mode is really fun to use such as taming an owl which can scout an area and mark enemies and a wolf that you can command to attack enemies. The world is green and lush and you will be in awe of the detail and colour of the land as you would normally associate the stone age with dullish tones. The story, for me anyway, is actually quite gripping so far. The crafting system has been heavily been re-designed and you now need specialist villagers to upgrade certain things on this menu. Oh and you get your own village with its own population and gain more based on what you do out in the world which is also fully upgradeable. In short, the game is worth every penny and it is a blast to play. Go For It without thinking. Its a Far Cry game afterall
