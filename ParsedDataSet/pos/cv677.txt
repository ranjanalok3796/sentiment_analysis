with times changing and adapting itself comes new designs implementations. developed by rockstar and not remedy , gone are days of noir styling winter settings of new york , this is the new payne who seems to booze regularly for his actions in the past for being a killer in his backstory and yet jumps from cover to cover in a john woo style with bullet time slowmo effects ripping through so many dudes even arnold in commando would be ashamed. gunplay and gameplay is polished and extremely well designed , however my biggest critism is that the developers want to rather show.me the cutscenes.and scripted sequences rather than making me.play for more than minutes every freaking time . this diminshes the goodwill and replayability for the game as the game is very tight and concise. the new setting for brazil is an interesting take on for a modern payne.saga and sound design is well presented. did you know this game is inspired from denzel washington's movie MAN ON FIRE. recommended only for fans looking to rip through painkiller addled bullet time shlowmoe action with expectation for a stop and go start in terms of gameplay and story loops.
