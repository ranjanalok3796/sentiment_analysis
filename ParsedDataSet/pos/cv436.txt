Farcry 3 (PC)If you are a fan of shooter and loves blowing things in people face, you will like it for sure. I won't go spoilers on stories , but this game has everything u want in shooter with Survival and few RPG system like Skill and various weapon choices. The game is so vast and full of things to do you will have few hours just to check all. Just a caution don't be Guns Blazing from start. Do level up higher and go kool. If u encounter levels on increasing , it is likely level cap for region. This game has so many side stuff and achievements. Also Twist and turns ! It is one the best shooter Out there !
