One of the best open world survivor game ever made. The game is undoubtedly difficult and thats where the fun begins.. The most interesting thing about the game was the language and english only used as subtitles that gives an amazingly realistic view..And last but not the least bloodfang sabsrtooth 👍👍👍The only thing i miss in the game was that it should have some online connectivity the whole game is offline :(
