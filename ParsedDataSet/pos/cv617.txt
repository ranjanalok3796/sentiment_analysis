A very good game. Installs fast. Gameplay is amazing, will keep you on your toes. I would reccommend playing it on hard at least, that's where the concept of stealth and creativity really come into play. Graphics are nice but could be sliiiightly better. I enjoyed this game a LOT. Would reccommend it to anyone who likes stealth games with violence in them. Could be a bit more open ended, but still fun.Thanks to amazon for quick delivery.
