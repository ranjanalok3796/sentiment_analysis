This is one of the best games I have seen so far. It has a great story-line which most of the games these days lacks. Along with this great story-line stunning graphics makes this game a must buy. I have started playing this game and I love it so far. Even the absence of guns doesn't matter when you have a perfect piece of cake like this. Good job developers.
