Its a great game and would recommend people who like both stealth games and action games to check it out. It allows for you playing different playstyles and mixing things up if you get bored with one.SpoilersI would not complete this game 100% because the last few C2 missions (you'll know what that means when you get to it) are half arsed and artificially difficult. but until C2 I enjoyed the entire game.
