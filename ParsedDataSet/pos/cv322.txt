Call of duty: Ghosts provides 3 play type campaign multiplayer and extinctionThe campaign features a present time America where the government has fallen and few brave souls known as ghosts (dog included) fight the enemy for the country. The installment features 2-4 man squad and put them in all possible battle ground including space, deep ocean and even provide a playable dog as a teammate. There is nothing new in the play type as usual bunch of goons running and shooting and story leaves you with bit disappointment at the end.The multiplayer includes 15 maps and which lack the space and the underwater and is almost identical to the previous releases. The only noticeable difference is the health which is lesser that call of duty black ops2. The environment fells brighter and realistic than the older instalments.FINAL conclusion: The game is worth giving a try for a COD fan, not a must play if you arenâ€™t a COD fan.
