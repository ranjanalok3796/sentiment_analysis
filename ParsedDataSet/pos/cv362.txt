I bought it for 350 and recieved it in 2 days. Since then I've been playing it everyday for 2 hours minimum. The main problem is that we have to download the whole 6+ GB game files from steam, but that's OK Cuz I left it downloading overnight and started playing it the next day.I bought it for 350 and recieved it in 2 days.
