Pros: Beautiful world to explore, Great variety of weaponsEven Greater variety of playstyles (stealth, action, hybrid) Strong cast of characters with is good story arc.Cons:Side quests are a bit light on content.Multiplayer is a bit weakOverall:One of the best games of 2012. A huge return to the greatness of FC1 mixed with the best parts of FC2. An open world game with a great cast and great story, mixed with flexible gameplay that really gives something to any player. The action is explosive, the direction of the story sequences is intense at times, but still I can't really feel at home on these islands. Far Cry 3 is the ultimate open sandbox: The player can do what he wants, where he wants it, when he wants it. But the credibility of the world suffers â€“ and with it my motivation.It is an exceptional FPS with fun mechanics and excellent characterization. Unfortunately it wastes a fair number of opportunities offered by its huge open-world background. Plus, the secondary activities are not as fun as they could have been, and the island is too extensive to be interesting in the long run.
