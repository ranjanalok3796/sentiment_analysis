Platform for Display: PC|Edition: Standard|Verified PurchaseDelivered within 4 days, but the seller's packing was average, as their was no airbubble packaging, instead cardbox only!Now, coming to the game, i have been waiting for division since it's E3 trailer 2 years ago, and yes graphics have been downgraded just a notch, but its still looks gorgeous! I own gtx970 paired with i5 4690, getting constant 60fps at high, 40fps at ultra. Moreover the game also looks good in low! I have played the main campaign half way, and it's been a blast whenever i team up with my cousin for co-op campaign or in dark zone! The only con of the game is you have to grind all the way upto level 30 to stand a chance in dark zone, moreover it's hilarious to go rogue! If anyone is scared about the low speed Internet speed believe me guys, i live in Himachal Pradesh, and bsnl broadband suckS! No lags or server shutdowns are rare. Overall rating 9/10! .5 deducted for grinding through boring side missions to gain xp, and .5 deducted as uplay simply sucks! For any queries contact me!
