I have tried to play max payne 2 on ps2 but for me graphics were not great or playable ,after listening so much about this one and reviews i knew it would be much better at ps3 ,got the game and its rocking great .story is great u feel his emotions and struggle to save his clients only few games have such binding story which u makes feel real and emotional whoile playing ,not like call of duty etc just senseless shooting .graphics are great and i m quite fussy about it it has to be relly good if i would term it good but graphocs are really good gameplay is very smooth ,cut scenes and story are spell binding .its bullet slow down feature makes u see flying bullets and kill enemy faster,but AI is not to mess with set it on high difficulty and it will torturing u ,well i mostly play normal dificulty because i m not here to compete or boast my skills for nothing but i love to enjoy game be with protagonist and enjoy playing game not stomping game controller which u need if u directly hit hihger difficultyanyways great game must buy for any ps 3 owner who is thing for third person shooter ,i wonder why is it called third person because logically third person is 2nd person technically comparing with first person shooter .well kudos order and get started on adventure with mr max payne
