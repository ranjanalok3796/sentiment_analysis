An awesome game for the series definitely worth playing more than once. I bought this a month back and just recently finished playing this, even though this game was big I still wanted more.So installation requires 30GB which took me almost 20 mins I think.Secondly this is not steam activated but you still get achievements from Rockstar Social ClubThirdly there is an update for this game which I think was huge (maybe close to 1GB) and it is recommended you do the update or else the game will crash on multiple areas, hence do the update.Fourthly multiplayer won't work because everybody is on GTA5 so don't bother trying.And finally stop reading this and if you haven't bought it then buy it and KICK A$$ !!!!!!!!!!!!!
