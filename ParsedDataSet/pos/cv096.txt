A very beautiful game from the Assasins Creed franchise that presents us with a lovely world with tons to do. The story is a little weak in my opinion but the naval battle in this game more than makes up for it. I would suggest any fan of the assasins creed series to go for this gam. You will not regret it.As for the delivery and packaging, Amazon did a fantastic job.
