Some just meant to be bought. Pros:1. Storyline is good2. Building your own special kind of base and recruiting people never gets old.3. Difficult at first but instead of annoying you want to get better.4. Free roam is fun not like other open world games.5. Graphics are great and feels like they put a lot of effort to make it more immersing for the players.Cons:1. Some missions are repeated and have highly increased difficulty are pain in the as*2. Ending is sloppy and rushed considering the story until the end was good.3. No badass antagonist.
