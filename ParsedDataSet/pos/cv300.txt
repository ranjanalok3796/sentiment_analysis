you see that all these people say that the game sucks!, well the multi player maps is kinda of confusing and takes time about 2 mins to find match, and the guns are awesome. the sinle player as all say is very easy!!!! yes it is. SO DO NOT PLAY ON EASY MODE!!!!. play it on the highest difficulty or 2nd highest diffulty to enjoy the game to the fullest! The game is not that bad. some SINGLE PLAYER missions r so fun that i replay them just to see the amazing effects and stunts! if u have played COD 1,2,3,mw1,mw2,mw3,bop1,2,3, then i would surely recommend this as a goU get 4 dvds so u need to just download about 500 mb from steam. thats it!
