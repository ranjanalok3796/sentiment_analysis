This has to be the best AC game for the next generation console so far ( Syndicate is pretty good as well)We all knew Unity was a disaster at launch.Having played Unity as well, I can say if you had to choose between Unity and Black Flag , ALWAYS go for Black Flag.The open world map is pretty huge. It takes a lot of time to travel all around the West Indies.I always loved the pirate themes i.e. POTC movies , One Piece anime. This game lets you like the life of a pirate.This game has content for more than 100 hours easily.The side missions are an absolute blast. The main story is pretty good as well.But nothing comes to close to those naval battles. Fighting ships with your Jackdaw is pretty amazing.The fighting is better than Unity hands down.The graphics are pretty amazing.The game is pretty cheap IMO. You can find better deals if you buy the digital version. The PlayStation Store usually has some deals.Kudos to Ubisoft for creating such a brilliant game which is still popular more than 2 years after its release.
