Platform for Display: PC|Edition: Standard|Verified PurchaseAverage game, decent graphics, ok game play but nothing ground breaking. When this game was showcased in E3 2013, it awed everyone. The final release was disappointing as the graphics were downgraded & the core game play elements excluded.Multiplayer piece of the game is something which can be enjoyed though. Especially in the dark zone.This is an online game & requires an active internet connection at all times. Even the single player campaign cannot be accessed if you are offline.Currently it not worth the price, may want to wait it out till it receives a price cut.
