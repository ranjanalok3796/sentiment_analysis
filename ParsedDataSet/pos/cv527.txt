Great game by rockstar , the car motion , it's physics are so damn accurate that you enjoy driving different segment cars throughout the game , main story is good and enjoyable if you are not the one to cut through the story scene in between missions. Graphics are great improvement over the previous version of course and gameplay UI is just magic considering previous GTA games .It's a GTA ! You know you are going to love it.
