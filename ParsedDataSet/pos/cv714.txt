What an amazing game. Hideo kojima is the king of stealth games.This game is almost perfect but the main issue is the story.Its lacking and not up to the previous titles. Nevertheless the rest of the game is freakin PERFECT.Just get it. Even if you don't like stealth games. There is something to do for everyone in this huge open world.Sadly it's the last good mgs game because stupid Konami fired hideo kojima and without him there's no metal gear.Thankingfully hideo kojima has started his own company and a new title is coming out next year named Death Stranding.Im totally oftopic, just get this game.
