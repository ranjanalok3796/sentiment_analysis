Though I generally don't do product reviews on Amazon, but this game is worth mentioning. I got MGS V Ground Zeroes(prequel to this game) free on PS4 and though I was never into MGS series, that game blew my mind. I generally play for about 1 hour a day when i get time and I normally game about 6 hours a week. But for Ground Zeroes, I completed each and every mission and challenge on every difficulty and that was the first time in my life I played continuously for 10 hours. So I pre ordered this game from Amazon. The package arrived on time and was well sealed and I got the DLCs as per advertisement. Now, after playing this game for small amounts from September(with breaks obviously!) and finally completing it, I got to say that this game is a blast and a complete package. This game very well justifies it's price of 3500(sometimes i think it's a bit lessüòÅ).I won't say that this game is perfect, but it is fun and that what matters. Some people say that this game has a bad story or something like that, but it is subjective. For me the game's ending was the best in video game history as it delivered a very strong moral message which many people don't seem to digest . About the rest of the story, it was O.K because as I said earlier I have never been into MGS games and the story is a bit complex(as it has always been the case with MGS Games).But I don't expect a Naughty Dog like story from every game I play.The game is lengthy enough and even if you buy today and play in small amounts every day, you will have a blast with it. Coming to the graphics, they are quite good on the PS4 and so is the game performance. I can't comment on MGS online because I don't have a PS Plus membership. But for those people who are looking for single player fun I would suggest this game to everyone who is looking for a game with value for money.
