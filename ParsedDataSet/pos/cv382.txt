The game has a great visual appeal and has quite an impressive gameplay.The game has a great visual appeal and has quite an impressive gameplay.However, it is not the kind of Cricket for PC that people have played before.Will take quite a while to get hold of it.Moreover, the energy and excitement of cricket is somewhat missing in the game.I am freak for Cricket on PC/Console, but not really playing this one a lot.A few people may or may not like it.BTW, the limited edition bundles with a controller (Chinese brand but decent in quality) and a SteelBook (nothing but an additional Metal Jewel Case to preserve/showoff your Game DVD)
