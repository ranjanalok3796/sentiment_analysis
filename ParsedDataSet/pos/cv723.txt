Got a day one edition game for just 1500â‚¹. Thanks amazon! As for the video game, it is awesome. Definitely a must buy. The only reason I didn't give a 5-star is because the story is confusing and the gameplay does get a bit repetitive after a while. That being said the graphics are beautiful and the combat system is great. The controls take a while to get used to though. Definitely recommend this game to everyone who's into stealth action games!
