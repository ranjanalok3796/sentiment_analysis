Well first of all this game will blow your mind the visuals are way beyond best even Witcher3 and Shadow of Mordor looks Lil bit like they are animated but this doesn't not even in 1080p I recently bought a 4k desktop and I'm really stunned with this game visuals they looks so damn real but the reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the package contains a steam key and a disk which doesn't include game data you have to download the whole game but that's not the issue the thing is you can get the game on steam for about 800rupees and Lil bit earlier on steam summer sale the game was available for only 524rupees
