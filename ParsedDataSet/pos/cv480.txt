Great game as expected, different than normal Far Cry game. Primal series brings the freshness to Far Cry series.There are no Guns in the game, you've to fight with Spear, Bows, Shard & Club. But good things is that the game has throwable weapons like Fire Bomb, Sting Bomb, Berserk bomb etc. Bombs will unlock in the later stage of the game.USP of this game is the Beast, If you've played Shangri-la stage in Far Cry 4 game then you remember there is tiger which follows with us and kills the opponents. Same thing happened with Primal, you can choose variety of animals as your pet. And they'll follow with you everywhere. There are also master animals which require special skills to tame them but there are very useful if you tame these in an early stage.The bad part of the game is you need resources lots of them, you'll fed up with the resource gathering.The Box comes up with 2 DVD and after that you need to download 800 MB extra to start playing game( Size changes when you'll purchase)
