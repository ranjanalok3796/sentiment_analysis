This game is just fantastic, it is a great improvement upon its predecessor, Ground Zeroes, but the only thing that I was led down with was the 20 GB download!!!! I know its mentioned in amazon's FAQ but still 20 GB's took some time to download.One other thing that people should be aware of is the system requirements, while the game's optimization is great, if you want smooth gameplay on ultra settings you should at least have a GTX 750, i have a GTX 760 and play the game with ZERO lag.
