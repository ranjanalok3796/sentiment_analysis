I should have waited and read more reviews before making this order. Honestly guys, the developers are just trying to suck the money out of you. I paid full for this game, and I got a disk with 1/10 game content in it. You have to download the whole freakin game. I have no idea how much because I am not going to download it myself. If you are rich, then get an internet plan and if you are the torrent guy then black box is out already so.... Go for blackbox. This is not worth the price. Thank you.
