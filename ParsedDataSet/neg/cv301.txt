Cd is good but if you are using cd key then valve will limit your account.Cd is good but if you are using cd key then valve will limit your account.If you have to use community market, send friend requests. Then again you have to add $5 in stream wallet. So its better to buy from stream account rather than cd. If you are happy with limited user account then go for it.I purchased the cd forâ‚¹500/- later I added $5 in steam wallet approx 850/- what's the use.Buy from steam @479/-
