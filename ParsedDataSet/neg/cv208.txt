Doesn't work for PC. Ubisoft DRM service doesn't allow you to play offline. The game never starts beyond the main menu. Not recommended for PC users.I tried resolving the issue with Ubisoft as well, but it was just a waste of time. And now I cannot even return this back to Amazon.Please DO NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE A PC. This game only works on consoles.
