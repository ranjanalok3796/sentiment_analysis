Most horrible game i have ever seen it requires 4G internet to download extra updated 10GB game data , and its original product from STREAM NETWORKS which requires 15 gb hard disk space 3 GB Ram is minimum, so if you dont have internet at you home dont buy this product , it may cost you more ....for installing this you need to make an account of stream and need to cheak your google account for a message ...its really trobling game , i never saw install procesure like this game in my life .... .but the games graphics is too good and game play is like motorstorm pacific rift...its multiplayer game upto 4 players. I.e offline , online is upto 12 players ...its you decision to accept this product to you home door , i actally got this product at Rs.25 only and its real price is around Rs.1000 ...so not a waste for me ......thank you amazon
