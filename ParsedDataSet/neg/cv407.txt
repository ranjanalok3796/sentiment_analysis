Even GTA Sand Andreas is better than this.Repetitive missions man.. do u wanna play it? Buy this if the price comes down, but certainly not at Rs.2500. Buy Watch Dogs 2 instead.This game has neet this person, meet that person, shoot 3 guys mission complete. Drive here. Drive there. See this scene. See that scene. That's it. Weapons are few, there's not even a motorcycle, and story is quite old.I'm not gonna suggest anyone to buy this.
