The 2 stars are for the amazing gameplay and the bonus Goro DLC that came with the pack. I hate that one has to download a 30 GB patch/installation for this to work. It seems a lot easier to provide 4 extra DVDs with the box. They seriously need to rethink their distribution. It took forever to download. Once it got installed, it was pure awesomeness.Note: I bought this from Cloudtail first, wherein I received a used product which wasn't wrapped in plastic and did not have anything (Serial Key) inside except the DVD. I returned it and was promptly refunded my money. I don't mean to tarnish the seller's image here as I have ordered other products worth a lot more and have been satisfied. But should anyone receive such a product, do return it promptly.
