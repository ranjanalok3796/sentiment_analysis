This is an absolutely terrible PC port. Very bad optimization and it feels like they rushed to release the game without finishing it. Using a GTX 970, I have to drop down to medium or even low settings to get a solid 60fps. The textures are awful and very blurry, it sometimes gets very distracting and the AI is also hilariously stupid, it makes dying in this game so tough even on the highest difficulty. There are also quite a few game-breaking glitches I have come across which leads to crashes or restarting.The core gameplay is also a bit repetitive and gives the player no incentive to get anything done enjoyably and the world is empty and nothing like other open world games with very few side quests and activities. But the shooting and driving feels solid and really well done.There are only two reasons this game deserves two stars. The soundtrack is amazing and totally fits the era that the game is set in and the story is excellent and really surprised me. The acting is superb and you can tell a lot of effort was put into this. Apart from this there isn't much to the game, it's not innovative and does many of the things other open world games like GTA does but worse. Mafia 2 is overall a much better Mafia game, this one feels like a huge step backward for the franchise sadly.
