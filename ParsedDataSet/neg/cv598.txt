I purchased this game with high expectation. But what I experienced was, when I got the game the game box' lamination was not there. I double checked the product in YouTube and it's laminated. Also the poster of scorpion was missing. They're was no manual which contains the CD key. If the CD key was there I would have never mind the poster and lamination. Amazon should take serious action against this.
