My system requirements & recommendations are perfectly matching with this game. Still I installed game as per instructed step by step. Still game doesn't start, I contacted SquareEnix, they told me to change resolution, I started game with all resolution still nothing happens. My problem is that when I start game via steam game doesn't run at all (only it shows in task manager), & shows me Error: "dumping info thread" with all resolutions
