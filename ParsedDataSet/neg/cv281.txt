I don't get it how this game is rated high in India.Two Stars1. Steam Game2. Story CampaignActivision dumped whole South Asia this timei never purchased any of these recent COD's after they introduced PEER-PEER Multiplayer system , first of all game has a swarm of hackers in it ( COD - Hackers paradise ) second of all Multiplayer Game lags like s*** for me constant freeze on multiplayer , i have a good internet connection 100mbps still i cant pay this game also i have a PC capable of running this game on Ultra ( in fact story mode i had like constant 60 Fps)... havent had had any issues with any multiplayer games... but this one here is like s***....Asians should avoid this game.. But also i can see many people here has given thumbs up for the game...don't know how they managed to play the game...
