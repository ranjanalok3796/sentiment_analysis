Really bad Port! The game is locked at 30 fps, frames dropping down to 28-29 while driving. Textures and text looka blurry. Before starting the game, you have a choice to turn on auto aim. You can only set the Graphics settings in the launcher and after the long intro cutscenes. No options menu in the main title menu. There are sound glitches when setting your audio to a higher sample rate. Bad mouse smoothing in menu, but quite decent in game.There is an FOV option but increasing it somehow decrease input text size.I'm really hyped for this game but they sabotaged the PC version (maybe gave us a beta build or something). Can't play for more than 2 minutes with the mouse and keyboard as it gives me migraine. They should have delayed the PC version when they clearly know it's not ready yet. Feels like playing afully priced Early Access game with Season Pass and micro DLC's and no support for sli. Developers promised patch. Game is crashing..
