DO Not Buy, the DVD only contains 8MB Steam Setup, the DVD does not has any Game setup files, Why pay 999 to purchase a game and then pay an additional amount to download 20GB of Data over the InternetInstead, Just buy directly from Steam and Download the gameThese guys should mention clearly on the box as well as in product description that DVD does not contain setup files1 star only for Amazon for refunding my amount
