It's not a double player game. The game has good graphics and that's it. Playstation became famous in its time due to the compatibility of group playing especially Mortal Kombat became famous as there was 2 player option in the story mode of the game in its playstation 2 version. Spending so much money on the game just to find out that it is single player is a total waste.
