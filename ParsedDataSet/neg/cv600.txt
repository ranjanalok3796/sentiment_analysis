This is cheating, I got the disk but not the game, not saying that its pirated but I have to download 30 gb of data on a 1mbps connection which will take ages. This was not mentioned when I bought the product, and the package arrived in very bad condition and not even in a DVD case but in a card board box with scratches on the DVD.
