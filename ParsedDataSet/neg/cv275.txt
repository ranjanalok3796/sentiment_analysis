By using the disk you can only install 16 GB. The game needs 45 GB. You have to download the rest.. If you don't have that much good facility to download.. Then please don't buy it.. If you have that much facility to download.. then get it from Steam. don't buy it as a disk.. It gives no use..I can't return the CD.. I have tried the same day when I bought this game.. But it shows we can't return the product..Please don't buy this game as a CD.. You are wasting your money just for a CD case..
