first of all lemme tell you that im a big fab of assassin series. i bought this game and thus my problems started. indtalled the game and after that ubisoft server was continuosly down dunno for what reasons. then i re installed ubisoft but instead of running the game it started downloading the game inspite of me having been already installed the game. i chose the locate game directory still nothing would happen. plz do not buy ubisoft games .instead buy it from steam .. its more comfortable
