Platform for Display: PC|Edition: Standard|Verified Purchase3 years ago when this ago was announced and revealed a gameplay, I was impressed, amazing graphics, spectacular dynamics and physics that are never seen before. So I waited patiently, 3 years later, pre-order it got it exactly the day after release, installed and came with an 1.5 gb update now it could be 3 I guess and after playing it a lot that is a month I got tired of it. I mean seriously the game is a magnet where every fight you encounter turns into a headshot rush. I've explored every part of the game and yes including dark zone and after I don't know finishing up all the missions it feels like I don't wanna play this anymore. I am actually done I mean I had more fun in Warcraft than this and it still is fun to play but The Division you will seriously get tired. I really wish they could have made this a single player campaign but no it's too late, and the funny part new DLCs are coming, you can pay for them or you can buy the season pass, I mean come on I still didn't get any value out of the money I spent for this now I have to pay more HELL NO !!!!
